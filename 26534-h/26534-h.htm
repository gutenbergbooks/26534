<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>&#8220;SNUGGY&#8221; AND THE ROSE PONY</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Hi, Rose! Up, girl! There&#8217;s another party
making for the View by the far path. Get a move
on, Rosie.&#8221;</p>
<p>The strawberry roan tossed her cropped mane
and her dainty little hoofs clattered more quickly
over the rocky path which led up from the far-reaching
grazing lands of Sunset Ranch to the
summit of the rocky eminence that bounded the
valley upon the east.</p>
<p>To the west lay a great, rolling plain, covered
with buffalo grass and sage; and dropping down
the arc of the sky was the setting sun, ruddy-countenanced,
whose almost level rays played full
upon the face of the bluff up which the pony
climbed so nimbly.</p>
<p>&#8220;On, Rosie, girl!&#8221; repeated the rider. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
let him get to the View before us. I don&#8217;t see
why anybody would wish to go there,&#8221; she added,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
with a jealous pang, &#8220;for it was father&#8217;s favorite
outlook. None of our boys, I am sure, would
come up here at this hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen Morrell was secure in this final opinion.
It was but a short month since Prince Morrell had
gone down under the hoofs of the steers in an unfortunate
stampede that had cost the Sunset Ranch
much beside the life of its well-liked owner.</p>
<p>The View&mdash;a flat table of rock on the summit
overlooking the valley&mdash;had become almost sacred
in the eyes of the punchers of Sunset Ranch since
Mr. Morrell&#8217;s death. For it was to that spot the
ranchman had betaken himself&mdash;usually with his
daughter&mdash;on almost every fair evening, to overlook
the valley and count the roaming herds which
grazed under his brand.</p>
<p>Helen, who was sixteen and of sturdy build,
could see the nearer herds now dotting the plain.
She had her father&#8217;s glasses slung over her shoulder,
and she had come to-night partly for the purpose
of spying out the strays along the watercourses
or hiding in the distant <i>coulées</i>.</p>
<p>But mainly her visit to the View was because
her father had loved to ride here. She could think
about him here undisturbed by the confusion and
bustle at the ranch-house. And there were some
things&mdash;things about her father and the sad conversation
they had had together before his taking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
away&mdash;that Helen wanted to speculate upon alone.</p>
<p>The boys had picked him up after the accident
and brought him home; and doctors had been
brought all the way from Helena to do what they
could for him. But Mr. Morrell had suffered
many bruises and broken bones, and there had been
no hope for him from the first.</p>
<p>He was not, however, always unconscious. He
was a masterful man and he refused to take drugs
to deaden the pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me know what I am about until I meet
death,&#8221; he had whispered. &#8220;I&mdash;am&mdash;not&mdash;afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yet, there was one thing of which he had
been sorely afraid. It was the thought of leaving
his daughter alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Snuggy!&#8221; he groaned, clinging to the
girl&#8217;s plump hand with his own weak one. &#8220;If
there were some of your own kind to&mdash;to leave you
with. A girl like you needs women about&mdash;good
women, and refined women. Squaws, and Greasers,
and half-breeds aren&#8217;t the kind of women-folk
your mother was brought up among.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know but I&#8217;ve done wrong these past
few years&mdash;since your mother died, anyway. I&#8217;ve
been making money here, and it&#8217;s all for you,
Snuggy. That&#8217;s fixed by the lawyer in Elberon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Big Hen Billings is executor and guardian of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
you and the ranch. I know I can trust him. But
there ought to be nice women and girls for you
to live with&mdash;like those girls who went to school
with you the four years you were in Denver.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet, this is your home. And your money is
going to be made here. It would be a crime to
sell out now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Snuggy! Snuggy! If your mother had
only lived!&#8221; groaned Mr. Morrell. &#8220;A woman
knows what&#8217;s right for a girl better than a man.
This is a rough place out here. And even the best
of our friends and neighbors are crude. You want
refinement, and pretty dresses, and soft beds, and
fine furniture&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, Father! I love Sunset Ranch just
as it is,&#8221; Helen declared, wiping away her tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye. &#8217;Tis a beauty spot&mdash;the beauty spot of
all Montana, I believe,&#8221; agreed the dying man.
&#8220;But you need something more than a beautiful
landscape.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But there are true hearts here&mdash;all our
friends!&#8221; cried Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so they are&mdash;God bless them!&#8221; responded
Prince Morrell, fervently. &#8220;But,
Snuggy, you were born to something better than
being a &#8216;cowgirl.&#8217; Your mother was a refined
woman. I have forgotten most of my college education;
but I had it once.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></p>
<p>&#8220;<i>This</i> was not our original environment. It
was not meant that we should be shut away from
all the gentler things of life, and live rudely
as we have. Unhappy circumstances did that
for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was silent for a moment, his face working
with suppressed emotion. Suddenly his grasp
tightened on the girl&#8217;s hand and he continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;Snuggy! I&#8217;m going to tell you something.
It&#8217;s something you ought to know, I believe. Your
mother was made unhappy by it, and I wouldn&#8217;t
want a knowledge of it to come upon you unaware,
in the after time when you are alone. Let me tell
you with my own lips, girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Father, what is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father&#8217;s name is under a cloud. There is
a smirch on my reputation. I&mdash;I ran away from
New York to escape arrest, and I have lived here
in the wilderness, without communicating with old
friends and associates, because I did not want the
matter stirred up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid of arrest, Father?&#8221; gasped Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;For your mother&#8217;s sake, and for yours,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;She couldn&#8217;t have borne it. It would have
killed her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you were not guilty, Father!&#8221; cried
Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know I wasn&#8217;t?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Father, you could never have done anything
dishonorable or mean&mdash;I know you could
not!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Snuggy!&#8221; the dying man replied,
with a smile hovering about his pain-drawn lips.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve been the greatest comfort a father ever
had, ever since you was a little, cuddly baby, and
liked to snuggle up against father under the
blankets.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was before the big ranch-house was
built, and we lived in a shack. I don&#8217;t know how
your mother managed to stand it, winters. <i>You</i>
just snuggled into my arms under the blankets&mdash;that&#8217;s
how we came to call you &#8216;Snuggy.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Snuggy&#8217; is a good name, Dad,&#8221; she declared.
&#8220;I love it, because <i>you</i> love it. And I know I
gave you comfort when I was little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, yes! <i>What</i> a comfort you were after
your poor mother died, Snuggy! Ah, well! you
shall have your reward, dear. I am sure of that.
Only I am worried that you should be left alone
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Big Hen and the boys will take care of me,&#8221;
Helen said, stifling her sobs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay, but you need women-folk about. Your
mother&#8217;s sister, now&mdash;The Starkweathers, if
they knew, might offer you a home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is, Aunt Eunice&#8217;s folks?&#8221; asked Helen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
&#8220;I remember mother speaking of Aunt Eunice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. She corresponded with Eunice until her
death. Of course, we haven&#8217;t heard from them
since. The Starkweathers naturally did not wish
to keep up a close acquaintanceship with me after
what happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, dear Dad! you haven&#8217;t told me what happened.
<i>Do</i> tell me!&#8221; begged the anxious girl.</p>
<p>Then the girl&#8217;s dying father told her of the
looted bank account of Grimes &amp; Morrell. The
cash assets of the firm had suddenly disappeared.
Circumstantial evidence pointed at Prince Morrell.
His partner and Starkweather, who had a small
interest in the firm, showed their doubt of him.
The creditors were clamorous and ugly. The
bookkeeper of the firm disappeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;They advised me to go away for a while; your
mother was delicate and the trouble was wearing
her into her grave. And so,&#8221; Mr. Morrell said,
in a shaking voice, &#8220;I ran away. We came out
here. You were born in this valley, Snuggy. We
hoped at first to take you back to New York, where
all the mystery would be explained. But that time
never came.</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither Starkweather, nor Grimes, seemed
able to help me with advice or information. Gradually
I got into the cattle business here. I prospered
here, while Fenwick Grimes prospered in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
New York. I understand he is a very wealthy
man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Soon after we came out here your Uncle
Starkweather fell heir to a big property and moved
into a mansion on Madison Avenue. He, and his
wife, and the three girls&mdash;Belle, Hortense and
Flossie&mdash;have everything heart could desire.</p>
<p>&#8220;And they have all I want my Snuggy to have,&#8221;
groaned Mr. Morrell. &#8220;They have refinement,
and books, and music, and all the things that make
life worth living for a woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I <i>love</i> Sunset Ranch!&#8221; cried Helen again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye. But I watched your mother. I know
how much she missed the gentler things she had
been brought up to. Had I been able to pay off
those old creditors while she was alive, she might
have gone back.</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; the ranchman sighed, &#8220;the stigma is
there. The blot is still on your father&#8217;s name,
Snuggy. People in New York still believe that I
was dishonest. They believe that with the proceeds
of my dishonesty I came out here and went
into the cattle business.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, my dear? Even the settling with our
old creditors&mdash;the creditors of Grimes &amp; Morrell&mdash;made
suspicion wag her tongue more eagerly
than ever. I paid every cent, with interest compounded
to the date of settlement. Grimes had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
long since had himself cleared of his debts and
started over again. I do not know even that he
and Starkweather know that I have been able to
clear up the whole matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, as I say, the stain upon my reputation
remains. I could never explain my flight. I
could never imagine what became of the money.
Somebody embezzled it, and <i>I</i> was the one who
ran away. Do you see, my dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>And Helen told him that she <i>did</i> see, and
assured him again and again of her entire trust in
his honor. But Mr. Morrell died with the
worry of the old trouble&mdash;the trouble that had
driven him across the continent&mdash;heavy upon his
mind.</p>
<p>And now it was serving to make Helen&#8217;s mind
most uneasy. The crime of which her father had
been accused was continually in her thoughts.</p>
<p>Who had really been guilty of the embezzlement?
The bookkeeper, who disappeared? Fenwick
Grimes, the partner? Or, <i>Who?</i></p>
<p>As the Rose pony&mdash;her own favorite mount&mdash;took
Helen Morrell up the bluff path to the View
on this evening, the remembrance of this long
talk with her father before he died was running in
the girl&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>Perhaps she was a girl who would naturally be
more seriously impressed than most, at sixteen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
She had been brought up among older people.
She was a wise little thing when she was a mere
toddler.</p>
<p>And after her mother&#8217;s death she had been her
father&#8217;s daily companion until she was old enough
to be sent away to be educated. The four long
terms at the Denver school had carried Helen
Morrell (for she had a quick mind) through those
grades which usually prepare girls for college.</p>
<p>When she came back after graduation, however,
she saw that her father needed her companionship
more than she needed college. And,
again, she was too domestic by nature to really
long for a higher education.</p>
<p>She was glad now&mdash;oh! so glad&mdash;that she had
remained at Sunset Ranch during these last few
months. Her father had died with her arms
about him. As far as he could be comforted,
Helen had comforted him.</p>
<p>But now, as she rode up the rocky trail, she
murmured to herself:</p>
<p>&#8220;If I could only clear dad&#8217;s name!&#8221;</p>
<p>Again she raised her eyes and saw a buckskin
pony and its rider getting nearer and nearer to the
summit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get on, Rose!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;That chap
will beat us out. Who under the sun can he
be?&#8221;</p>

&#8220;HELEN CREPT ON HANDS AND KNEES TO THE EDGE OF THE BLUFF.&#8221;<br />
(Page 14)<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></div>
<p>She was sure the rider of the buckskin was no
Sunset puncher. Yet he seemed garbed in the
usual chaps, sombrero, flannel shirt and gay neckerchief
of the cowpuncher.</p>
<p>&#8220;And there isn&#8217;t another band of cattle nearer
than Froghole,&#8221; thought the girl, adjusting her
body to the Rose pony&#8217;s quickened gait.</p>
<p>She did not know it, but she was quite as much
an object of interest to the strange rider as he
was to her. And it was worth while watching
Helen Morrell ride a pony.</p>
<p>The deep brown of her cheek was relieved by
a glow of healthful red. Her thick plaits of hair
were really sunburned; her thick eyebrows were
startlingly light compared with her complexion.</p>
<p>Her eyes were dark gray, with little golden
lights playing in them; they seemed fairly to
twinkle when she laughed. Her lips were as red as
ripe sumac berries; her nose, straight, long, and
generously moulded, was really her handsomest
feature, for of course her hair covered her dainty
ears more or less.</p>
<p>From the rolling collar of her blouse her neck
rose firm and solid&mdash;as strong-looking as a boy&#8217;s.
She was plump of body, with good shoulders, a
well-developed arm, and her ornamented russet
riding boots, with a tiny silver spur in each heel,
covered very pretty and very small feet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>Her hand, if plump, was small, too; but the
gauntlets she wore made it seem larger and more
mannish than it was. She rode as though she were
a part of the pony.</p>
<p>She had urged on the strawberry roan and now
came out upon the open plateau at the top of the
bluff just as the buckskin mounted to the same level
from the other side.</p>
<p>The rock called &#8220;the View&#8221; was nearer to the
stranger than to herself. It overhung the very
steepest drop of the eminence.</p>
<p>Helen touched Rose with the spur, and the pony
whisked her tail and shot across the uneven sward
toward the big boulder where Helen and her father
had so often stood to survey the rolling acres of
Sunset Ranch.</p>
<p>Whether the stranger on the buckskin thought
her mount had bolted with her, Helen did not
know. But she heard him cry out, saw him
swing his hat, and the buckskin started on a hard
gallop along the verge of the precipice toward
the very goal for which the Rose pony was headed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The foolish fellow! He&#8217;ll be killed!&#8221; gasped
Helen, in sudden fright. &#8220;That soil there crumbles
like cheese! There! He&#8217;s down!&#8221;</p>
<p>She saw the buckskin&#8217;s forefoot sink. The brute
stumbled and rolled over&mdash;fortunately for the
pony <i>away</i> from the cliff&#8217;s edge.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>But the buckskin&#8217;s rider was hurled into the
air. He sprawled forward like a frog diving and&mdash;without
touching the ground&mdash;passed over the
brink of the precipice and disappeared from
Helen&#8217;s startled gaze.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>DUDLEY STONE</h3>
</div>

<p>The victim of the accident made no sound. No
scream rose from the depths after he disappeared.
The buckskin pony rolled over, scrambled
to its feet, and cantered off across the plateau.</p>
<p>Helen Morrell had swerved her own mount farther
to the south and came to the edge of the
caved-in bit of bank with a rush of hoofs that
ended in a wild scramble as she bore down upon
the Rose pony&#8217;s bit.</p>
<p>She was out of her saddle, and had flung the
reins over Rose&#8217;s head, on the instant. The well-trained
pony stood like a rock.</p>
<p>The girl, her heart beating tumultuously, crept
on hands and knees to the crumbling edge of the
bluff.</p>
<p>She knew its scarred face well. There were outcropping
boulders, gravel pits, ledges of shale,
brush clumps and a few ragged trees clinging
tenaciously to the water-worn gullies.</p>
<p>She expected to see the man crushed and bleeding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
on some rock below. Perhaps he had rolled
clear to the bottom.</p>
<p>But as her swift gaze searched the face of the
bluff, there was no rock, splotched with red, in her
line of vision. Then she saw something in the
top of one of the trees, far down.</p>
<p>It was the yellow handkerchief which the stranger
had worn. It fluttered in the evening breeze
like a flag of distress.</p>
<p>&#8220;E-e-e-<i>yow!</i>&#8221; cried Helen, making a horn of
her hands as she leaned over the edge of the precipice,
and uttering the puncher&#8217;s signal call.</p>
<p>&#8220;E-e-e-<i>yow!</i>&#8221; came up a faint reply.</p>
<p>She saw the green top of the tree stir. Then
a face&mdash;scratched and streaked with blood&mdash;appeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the love of heaven!&#8221; called a thin voice.
&#8220;Get somebody with a rope. I&#8217;ve got to have
some help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a rope right here. Pass it under your
arms, and I&#8217;ll swing you out of that tree-top,&#8221;
replied Helen, promptly.</p>
<p>She jumped up and went to the pony. Her rope&mdash;she
would no more think of traveling without
it than would one of the Sunset punchers&mdash;was
coiled at the saddlebow.</p>
<p>Running back to the verge of the bluff she
planted her feet on a firm boulder and dropped the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
coil into the depths. In a moment it was in the
hands of the man below.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over your head and shoulders!&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can never hold me!&#8221; he called back,
faintly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You do as you&#8217;re told!&#8221; she returned, in a
severe tone. &#8220;I&#8217;ll hold you&mdash;don&#8217;t you fear.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had already looped her end of the rope over
the limb of a tree that stood rooted upon the brink
of the bluff. With such a purchase she would be
able to hold all the rope itself would hold.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ready!&#8221; she called down to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right! Here I swing!&#8221; was the reply.</p>
<p>Leaning over the brink, rather breathless, it
must be confessed, the girl from Sunset Ranch saw
him swing out of the top of the tree.</p>
<p>The tree-top was all of seventy feet from its
roots. If he slipped now he would suffer a fall
that surely would kill him.</p>
<p>But he was able to help himself. Although he
crashed once against the side of the bluff and set
a bushel of gravel rattling down, in a moment he
gained foothold on a ledge. There he stood,
wavering until she paid off a little of the line.
Then he dropped down to get his breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you safe?&#8221; she shouted down to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure! I can sit here all night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want to, I suppose?&#8221; she asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not so&#8217;s you&#8217;d notice it. I guess I can get
down after a fashion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurt bad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my foot, mostly&mdash;right foot. I believe it&#8217;s
sprained, or broken. It&#8217;s sort of in the way when I
move about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your face looks as if that tree had combed it
some,&#8221; commented Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; replied the youth. &#8220;Beauty&#8217;s
only skin deep, at best. And I&#8217;m not proud.&#8221;</p>
<p>She could not see him very well, for the sun had
dropped so low that down where he lay the face
of the bluff was in shadow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what are you going to do? Climb up,
or down?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe getting down would be easier&mdash;&#8217;specially
if you let me use your rope.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But then, there&#8217;d be my pony. I couldn&#8217;t get
him with this foot&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll catch him. My Rose can run down anything
on four legs in these parts,&#8221; declared the
girl, briskly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And can you get down here to the foot of this
cliff where I&#8217;m bound to land?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I know the way in the dark. Got
matches?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then you build some kind of a smudge when
you reach the bottom. That&#8217;ll show me where
you are. Now I&#8217;m going to drop the rope to you.
Look out it doesn&#8217;t get tangled.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right! Let &#8217;er come!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to leave you if I&#8217;m to catch that buckskin
before it gets dark, stranger. You&#8217;ll get
along all right?&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surest thing you know!&#8221;</p>
<p>She dropped the rope. He gathered it in
quickly and then uttered a cheerful shout.</p>
<p>&#8220;All clear?&#8221; asked Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about me. I&#8217;m all right,&#8221; he
assured her.</p>
<p>Helen leaped back to her waiting pony. Already
the golden light was dying out of the sky.
Up here in the foothills the &#8220;evening died hard&#8221;
as the saying is; but the buckskin pony had romped
clear across the plateau. He was now, indeed, out
of sight.</p>
<p>She whirled Rose about and set off at a gallop
after the runaway. It was not until then that she
remembered she had no rope. That buckskin
would have to be fairly run down. There would
be no roping him.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if you can&#8217;t do it, no other horsie can,&#8221;
she said, aloud, patting the Rose pony on her arching
neck. &#8220;Go it, girl! Let&#8217;s see if we can&#8217;t beat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
any miserable little buckskin that ever came into
this country. A strawberry roan forever!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her &#8220;E-e-e-yow! yow!&#8221; awoke the pony to
desperate endeavor. She seemed to merely skim
the dry grass of the open plateau, and in ten minutes
Helen saw a riderless mount plunging up the
side of a <i>coulée</i> far ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;There he goes!&#8221; cried the girl. &#8220;After him,
Rosie! Make your pretty hoofs fly!&#8221;</p>
<p>The excitement of the chase roused in Helen
that feeling of freedom and confidence that is a
part of life on the plains. Those who live
much in the open air, and especially in the saddle,
seldom think of failure.</p>
<p>She knew she was going to catch the runaway
pony. Such an idea as non-success never entered
her mind. This was the first hard riding she had
done since Mr. Morrell died; and now her
thoughts expanded and she shook off the hopeless
feeling which had clouded her young heart and
mind since they had buried her father.</p>
<p>While she rode on, and rode hard, after the
fleeing buckskin her revived thought kept time
with the pony&#8217;s hoofbeats.</p>
<p>No longer did the old tune run in her head:
&#8220;If I only <i>could</i> clear dad&#8217;s name!&#8221; Instead
the drum of confidence beat a charge to arms: &#8220;I
know I <i>can</i> clear his name!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>&#8220;To think of poor dad living out here all
these years, with suspicion resting on his reputation
back there in New York. And he wasn&#8217;t
guilty! It was that partner of his, or that bookkeeper,
who was guilty. That is the secret of it,&#8221;
Helen told herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go back East and find out all about it,&#8221;
determined the girl, as her pony carried her
swiftly over the ground. &#8220;Up, Rose! There he
is! Don&#8217;t let him get away from us!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her interest in the chase of the buckskin pony
and in the mystery of her father&#8217;s trouble ran side
by side.</p>
<p>&#8220;On, on!&#8221; she urged Rose. &#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t
I go East? Big Hen can run the ranch well
enough. And there are my cousins&mdash;and auntie.
If Aunt Eunice resembles mother&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go it, Rose! There&#8217;s our quarry!&#8221;</p>
<p>She stooped forward in the saddle, and as the
Rose pony, running like the wind, passed the now
staggering buckskin, Helen snatched the dragging
rein, and pulled the runaway around to follow in
her own wake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, now! Easy!&#8221; she commanded her
mount, who obeyed her voice quite as well as
though she had tugged at the reins. &#8220;Now we&#8217;ll
go back quietly and trail this useless one along
with us.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come up, Buck! Easy, Rose!&#8221; So she
urged them into the same gait, returning in a
wide circle toward the path up which she had
climbed before the sun went down&mdash;the trail to
Sunset Ranch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! I can do it!&#8221; she cried, thinking aloud.
&#8220;I can and will go to New York. I&#8217;ll find out
all about that old trouble. Uncle Starkweather
can tell me, probably.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then it will please father.&#8221; She spoke as
though Mr. Morrell was sure to know her decision.
&#8220;He will like it if I go to live with them
a spell. He said it is what I need&mdash;the refining
influence of a nice home.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I <i>would</i> love to be with nice girls again&mdash;and
to hear good music&mdash;and put on something
beside a riding skirt when I go out of the
house.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sighed. &#8220;One cannot have a cow ranch and
all the fripperies of civilization, too. Not very
well. I&mdash;I guess I am longing for the flesh-pots
of Egypt. Perhaps poor dad did, too. Well, I&#8217;ll
give them a whirl. I&#8217;ll go East&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, where&#8217;s that fellow&#8217;s fire?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was descending the trail into the pall of
dusk that had now spread over the valley. Far
away she caught a glimmer of light&mdash;a lantern on
the porch at the ranch-house.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
But right below here where she wished to see a
light, there was not a spark.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope nothing&#8217;s happened to him,&#8221; she
mused. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe he is one of us; if he had
been he wouldn&#8217;t have raced a pony so close to
the edge of the bluff.&#8221;</p>
<p>She began to &#8220;co-ee! co-ee!&#8221; as the ponies clattered
down the remainder of the pathway. And
finally there came an answering shout. Then a
little glimmer of light flashed up&mdash;again and yet
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Matches!&#8221; grumbled Helen. &#8220;Can&#8217;t he find
anything dry to burn down there and so make a
steady light?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shouted again.</p>
<p>&#8220;This way, Miss!&#8221; she heard the stranger
cry.</p>
<p>The ponies picked their way carefully over the
loose shale that had fallen to the foot of the bluff.
There were trees, too, to make the way darker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi!&#8221; cried Helen. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you light a
fire?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, to tell you the truth, I had some difficulty
in getting down here, and I&mdash;I had to
rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>The words were followed by a groan that the
young man evidently could not suppress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you&#8217;re more badly hurt than you said!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
cried the girl. &#8220;I&#8217;d better get help; hadn&#8217;t
I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A doctor is out of the question, I guess. I
believe that foot&#8217;s broken.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! You&#8217;re from the East!&#8221; she said, suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;How so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You say &#8216;guess&#8217; in that funny way. And that
explains it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Explains what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your riding so recklessly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My goodness!&#8221; exclaimed the other, with a
short laugh. &#8220;I thought the whole West was
noted for reckless riding.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no. It only <i>looks</i> reckless,&#8221; she returned,
quietly. &#8220;Our boys wouldn&#8217;t ride a pony close
to the edge of a steep descent like that up yonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. I&#8217;m in the wrong,&#8221; admitted the
stranger. &#8220;But you needn&#8217;t rub it in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to,&#8221; said Helen, quickly. &#8220;I
have a bad habit of talking out loud.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed at that. &#8220;You&#8217;re frank, you mean?
I like that. Be frank enough to tell me how I am
to get back to Badger&#8217;s&mdash;even on ponyback&mdash;to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Impossible,&#8221; declared Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, perhaps I <i>had</i> better make an effort
to make camp.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no! It&#8217;s only a few miles to the ranch-house.
I&#8217;ll hoist you up on your pony. The trail&#8217;s
easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whose ranch is it?&#8221; he asked, with another
suppressed groan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mine&mdash;Sunset Ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sunset Ranch! Why, I&#8217;ve heard of that. One
of the last big ranches remaining in Montana;
Isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost as big as 101?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Helen, briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t know a girl owned it,&#8221; said the
other, curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t&mdash;until lately. My father, Prince
Morrell, has just died.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; exclaimed the other, in a softened tone.
&#8220;And you are Miss Morrell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am. And who are you? Easterner, of
course?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You guessed right&mdash;though, I suppose, you
&#8216;reckon&#8217; instead of &#8216;guess.&#8217; I&#8217;m from New
York.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; queried Helen. &#8220;That&#8217;s a
place I want to see before long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll be disappointed,&#8221; remarked the
other. &#8220;My name is Dudley Stone, and I was
born and brought up in New York and have lived
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
there all my life until I got away for this trip
West. But, believe me, if I didn&#8217;t have to I would
never go back!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you have to go back?&#8221; asked Helen,
simply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Business. Necessity of earning one&#8217;s living.
I&#8217;m in the way of being a lawyer&mdash;when my days
of studying, and all, are over. And then, I&#8217;ve
got a sister who might not fit into the mosaic of
this freer country, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Dudley Stone,&#8221; quoth the girl from
Sunset Ranch, &#8220;we&#8217;d better not stay talking here.
It&#8217;s getting darker every minute. And I reckon
your foot needs attention.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate to move it,&#8221; confessed the young Easterner.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t stay here, you know,&#8221; insisted
Helen. &#8220;Where&#8217;s my rope?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I had to hitch one end of it up
above and let myself down by it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it might have come in handy to lash you
on the pony. I don&#8217;t mind about the rope otherwise.
One of the boys will bring it in for me to-morrow.
Now, let&#8217;s see what we can do towards
hoisting you into your saddle.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE MISTRESS OF SUNSET RANCH</h3>
</div>

<p>Dudley Stone had begun to peer wonderingly
at this strange girl. When he had first sighted
her riding her strawberry roan across the plateau
he supposed her to be a little girl&mdash;and really,
physically, she did not seem much different from
what he had first supposed.</p>
<p>But she handled this situation with all the calmness
and good sense of a much older person. She
spoke like the men and women he had met during
his sojourn in the West, too.</p>
<p>Yet, when he was close to her, he saw that she
was simply a young girl with good health, good
muscles, and a rather pretty face and figure. He
called her &#8220;Miss&#8221; because it seemed to flatter
her; but Dud Stone felt himself infinitely older
than this girl of Sunset Ranch.</p>
<p>It was she who went about getting him aboard
the pony, however; he never could have done it
by himself. Nor was it so easily done as said.</p>
<p>In the first place, the badly trained buckskin
didn&#8217;t want to stand still. And the young man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
was in such pain that he really was unable to aid
Helen in securing the pony.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, you take Rose,&#8221; commanded the girl,
at length. &#8220;She&#8217;d stand for anything. Up you
come, now, sir!&#8221;</p>
<p>The young fellow was no weakling. But when
he put one arm over the girl&#8217;s strong shoulder, and
was hoisted erect, she felt him quiver all over. She
knew that the pain he suffered must be intense.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoa, Rose, girl!&#8221; commanded Helen.
&#8220;Back around! Now, sir, up with that lame leg.
It&#8217;s got to be done&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it!&#8221; he panted, and by a desperate
effort managed to get the broken foot over the
saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Up with you!&#8221; said Helen, and hoisted him
with a man&#8217;s strength into the saddle. &#8220;Are you
there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Ouch! Yes,&#8221; returned the Easterner. &#8220;I&#8217;m
here. No knowing how long I&#8217;ll stick, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better stick. Here! Put this foot in
the stirrup. Don&#8217;t suppose you can stand the other
in it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! I really couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll go slow. Hi, there! Come here,
you Buck!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a vicious little scoundrel,&#8221; said the young
man.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He ought to have a course of sprouts under
one of our wranglers,&#8221; remarked the girl from
Sunset Ranch. &#8220;Now let&#8217;s go along.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the buckskin&#8217;s dancing and cavorting,
she mounted, stuck the spurs into him a couple of
times, and the ill-mannered pony decided that walking
properly was better than bucking.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a wonder!&#8221; exclaimed Dud Stone, admiringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t been West long,&#8221; she replied,
with a smile. &#8220;Women folk out here aren&#8217;t much
afraid of horses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say they were not&mdash;if you are a
specimen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just ordinary. I spent four school terms
in Denver, and I never rode there, so I kind
of lost the hang of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dud Stone was becoming anxious over another
matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure you can find the trail when it&#8217;s
so dark?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re on it now,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re so sure,&#8221; he returned, grimly.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t see the ground, even.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the ponies know, if I don&#8217;t,&#8221; observed
Helen, cheerfully. &#8220;Nothing to be afraid of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you think I <i>am</i> kind of a tenderfoot?&#8221;
he returned.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not used to night traveling on the cattle
range,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You see, we lay our courses
by the stars, just as mariners do at sea. I can find
my way to the ranch-house from clear beyond
Elberon, as long as the stars show.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he sighed, &#8220;this is some different
from riding on the bridle-path in Central
Park.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s in New York?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean to go there. It&#8217;s really a big city, I
suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Makes Denver look like a village,&#8221; said Stone,
laughing to smother a groan.</p>
<p>&#8220;So father said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have people there, I hope?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Father and mother came from there. It
was before I was born, though. You see, I&#8217;m a
real Montana product.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And a mighty fine one!&#8221; he murmured. Then
he said aloud: &#8220;Well, as long as you&#8217;ve got folks
in the big city, it&#8217;s all right. But it&#8217;s the loneliest
place on God&#8217;s earth if one has no friends and
no confidants. I know that to be true from what
boys have told me who have come there from out
of town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve got folks,&#8221; said Helen, lightly.
&#8220;How&#8217;s the foot now?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Bad,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;It hangs loose, you
see&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; commanded Helen, dismounting.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve a long way to travel yet. That foot must
be strapped so that it will ride easier. Wait!&#8221;</p>
<p>She handed him her rein to hold and went
around to the other side of the Rose pony. She
removed her belt, unhooked the empty holster
that hung from it, and slipped the holster into her
pocket. Few of the riders carried a gun on Sunset
Ranch unless the coyotes proved troublesome.</p>
<p>With her belt Helen strapped the dangling leg
to the saddle girth. The useless stirrup, that
flopped and struck the lame foot, she tucked up
out of the way.</p>
<p>With tender fingers she touched the wounded
foot. She could feel the fever through the boot.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;d better keep your boot on till we get
home, Dud Stone,&#8221; advised Helen. &#8220;It will sort
of hold it together and perhaps keep the pain from
becoming greater than you can bear. But I guess
it hurts mighty bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It sure does, Miss Morrell,&#8221; he returned,
grimly. &#8220;Is&mdash;is the ranch far?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some distance. And we&#8217;ve got to walk. But
bear up if you can&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She saw him waver in the saddle. If he fell,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
she could not be sure just how Rose, the spirited
pony, would act.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say!&#8221; she said, coming around and walking
by his side, leading the other mount by the bridle.
&#8220;You lean on me. Don&#8217;t want you falling out of
the saddle. Too hard work to get you back
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you think I <i>am</i> a tenderfoot!&#8221; muttered
young Stone.</p>
<p>He never knew how they reached Sunset Ranch.
The fall, the terrible wrench of his foot, and the
endurance of the pain was finally too much for him.
In a half-fainting condition he sank part of his
weight on the girl&#8217;s shoulder, and she sturdily
trudged along the rough trail, bearing him up until
she thought her own limbs would give way.</p>
<p>At last she even had to let the buckskin run at
large, he made her so much trouble. But the Rose
pony was &#8220;a dear!&#8221;</p>
<p>Somewhere about ten o&#8217;clock the dogs began to
bark. She saw the flash of lanterns and heard the
patter of hoofs.</p>
<p>She gave voice to the long range yell, and a
dozen anxious punchers replied. Great discussion
had arisen over where she could have gone, for
nobody had seen her ride off toward the View that
afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whar you been, gal?&#8221; demanded Big Hen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
Billings, bringing his horse to a sudden stop across
the trail. &#8220;Hul-<i>lo!</i> What&#8217;s that you got with
yer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A tenderfoot. Easy, Hen! I&#8217;ve got his leg
strapped to the girth. He&#8217;s in bad shape,&#8221; and
she related, briefly, the particulars of the accident.</p>
<p>Dudley Stone had only a hazy recollection later
of the noise and confusion of his arrival. He was
borne into the house by two men&mdash;one of them the
ranch foreman himself.</p>
<p>They laid him on a couch, cut the boot from his
injured foot, and then the sock he wore.</p>
<p>Hen Billings, with bushy whiskers and the
frame of a giant, was nevertheless as tender with
the injured foot as a woman. Water with a
chunk of ice floating in it was used to reduce the
swelling. The foreman&#8217;s blunted fingers probed
for broken bones.</p>
<p>But it seemed there was none. It was only a
bad sprain, and they finally stripped him to his
underclothes and bandaged the foot with cloths
soaked with ice water.</p>
<p>When they got him into bed&mdash;in an adjoining
room&mdash;the young mistress of Sunset Ranch reappeared,
with a tray and napkins, with which she
arranged a table.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what he wants&mdash;some good grub under
his belt, Snuggy,&#8221; said the gigantic foreman,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
finally lighting his pipe. &#8220;He&#8217;ll be all right in a
few days. I&#8217;ll send word to Creeping Ford for
one of the boys to ride down to Badger&#8217;s and tell
&#8217;em. That&#8217;s where Mr. Stone says he&#8217;s been stopping.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re mighty kind,&#8221; said the Easterner,
gratefully, as Sing, the Chinese servant, shuffled in
with a steaming supper.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re glad to have a chance to play Good
Samaritan in this part of the country,&#8221; said Helen,
laughing. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that so, Hen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Snuggy,&#8221; replied the foreman,
patting her on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Dud Stone looked at Helen curiously, as the
big man strode out of the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;What an odd name!&#8221; he commented.</p>
<p>&#8220;My father called me that, when I was a
tiny baby,&#8221; replied the girl. &#8220;And I love it. All
my friends call me &#8216;Snuggy.&#8217; At least, all my
ranch friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s too soon for me to begin, I suppose?&#8221;
he said, laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, quite too soon,&#8221; returned Helen, as composedly
as a person twice her age. &#8220;You had
better stick to &#8216;Miss Morrell,&#8217; and remember that
I am the mistress of Sunset Ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I notice that you take liberties with <i>my</i>
name,&#8221; he said, quickly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s different. You&#8217;re a man. Men around
here always shorten their names, or have nicknames.
If they call you by your full name that
means the boys don&#8217;t like you. And I liked you
from the start,&#8221; said the Western girl, quite
frankly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you!&#8221; he responded, his eyes twinkling.
&#8220;I expect it must have been my fine riding
that attracted you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Nor it wasn&#8217;t your city cowpuncher
clothes,&#8221; she retorted. &#8220;I know those things
weren&#8217;t bought farther West than Chicago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A palpable hit!&#8221; admitted Dudley Stone.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. It was when you took that tumble into
the tree; was hanging on by your eyelashes, yet
could joke about it,&#8221; declared Helen, warmly.</p>
<p>She might have added, too, that now he had
been washed and his hair combed, he was an
attractive-looking young man. She did not believe
Dudley Stone was of age. His brown hair curled
tightly all over his head, and he sported a tiny
golden mustache. He had good color and was
somewhat bronzed.</p>
<p>Dud&#8217;s blue eyes were frank, his lips were red
and nicely curved; but his square chin took away
from the lower part of his face any suggestion of
effeminacy. His ears were generous, as was
his nose. He had the clean-cut, intelligent look
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
of the better class of educated Atlantic seaboard
youth.</p>
<p>There is a difference between them and the
young Westerner. The latter are apt to be hung
loosely, and usually show the effect of range-riding&mdash;at
least, back here in Montana. Whereas Dud
Stone was compactly built.</p>
<p>They chatted quite frankly while the patient
ate his supper. Dud found that, although Helen
used many Western idioms, and spoke with an
abruptness that showed her bringing up among
plain-spoken ranch people, she could, if she so
desired, use &#8220;school English&#8221; with good taste,
and gave other evidences in her conversation of
being quite conversant with the world of which he
was himself a part when he was at home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you would get along all right in New
York,&#8221; he said, laughing, when she suggested a
doubt as to the impression she might make upon
her relatives in the big town. &#8220;You&#8217;d not be half
the &#8216;tenderfoot&#8217; there that I am here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No? Then I reckon I can risk shocking
them,&#8221; laughed Helen, her gray eyes dancing.</p>
<p>This talk she had with Dud Stone on the evening
of his arrival confirmed the young mistress of
Sunset Ranch in her intention of going to the great
city.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>HEADED EAST</h3>
</div>

<p>When Helen Morrell made up her mind to do
a thing, she usually did it. A cataclysm of nature
was about all that would thwart her determination.</p>
<p>This being yielded to and never thwarted, even
by her father, might have spoiled a girl of different
calibre. But there was a foundation of good
common sense to Helen&#8217;s nature.</p>
<p>&#8220;Snuggy won&#8217;t kick over the traces much,&#8221;
Prince Morrell had been wont to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right you are, Boss,&#8221; had declared Big Hen
Billings. &#8220;It&#8217;s usually safe to give her her head.
She&#8217;ll bring up somewhar.&#8221;</p>
<p>But when Helen mentioned her eastern trip to
the old foreman he came &#8220;purty nigh goin&#8217; up in
th&#8217; air his own se&#8217;f!&#8221; as he expressed it.</p>
<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;yer wanter do anythin&#8217; like that air
for, Snuggy?&#8221; he demanded, in a horrified tone.
&#8220;Great jumping Jehosaphat! Ain&#8217;t this yere valley
big enough fo&#8217; you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes I think it&#8217;s too big,&#8221; admitted
Helen, laughing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, by jo! you&#8217;ll fin&#8217; city quarters close&#8217;t
&#8217;nough&mdash;an&#8217; that&#8217;s no josh. Huh! Las&#8217; time ever
I went to Chicago with a train-load of beeves I
went to see Kellup Flemming what useter work
here on this very same livin&#8217; Sunset Ranch. You
don&#8217;t remember him. You was too little,
Snuggy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard you speak of him, Hen,&#8221; observed
the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, thar was Kellup, as smart a young feller
as you&#8217;d find in a day&#8217;s ride, livin&#8217; with his
wife an&#8217; kids in what he called a <i>flat</i>. Be-lieve me!
It was some perpendicular to git into, an&#8217; no
<i>flat</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we gits inside and inter what he called
his parlor, he looks around like he was proud of
it (By jo! I&#8217;d be afraid ter shrug my shoulders in
it, &#8217;twas so small) an&#8217; says he: &#8216;What d&#8217;ye think
of the ranch, Hen?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ranch,&#8217; mind yeh! I was plumb insulted. I
says: &#8216;It&#8217;s all right&mdash;what there is of it&mdash;only,
what&#8217;s that crack in the wall for, Kellup?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Sufferin&#8217; tadpoles!&#8217; yells Kellup&mdash;jest like
that! &#8216;Sufferin&#8217; tadpoles! That ain&#8217;t no crack in
the wall. That&#8217;s our private hall.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Great jumping Jehosaphat!&#8221; exclaimed Hen,
roaring with laughter. &#8220;Yuh don&#8217;t wanter git
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
inter no place like that in New York. Can&#8217;t
breathe in the house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess Uncle Starkweather lives in a little
better place than that,&#8221; said Helen, after laughing
with the old foreman. &#8220;His house is on Madison
Avenue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t care where it is; there natcherly won&#8217;t
be no such room in a city dwelling as there is here
at Sunset Ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose not,&#8221; admitted the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! Won&#8217;t be room in the yard for a cow,&#8221;
growled Big Hen. &#8220;Nor chickens. Whatter yer
goin&#8217; to do without a fresh aig, Snuggy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect that will be pretty tough, Hen. But
I feel like I must go, you see,&#8221; said the girl, dropping
into the idiom of Sunset Ranch. &#8220;Dad
wanted me to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Boss <i>wanted</i> yuh to?&#8221; gasped the giant,
surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Hen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He never said nothin&#8217; to me about it,&#8221; declared
the foreman of Sunset Ranch, shaking his
bushy head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No? Didn&#8217;t he say anything about my being
with women folk, and under different circumstances?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh, yes! But I reckoned on getting Mis&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
Polk and Mis&#8217; Harry Frieze to take turns coming
over yere and livin&#8217; with yuh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that isn&#8217;t all dad wanted,&#8221; continued the
girl, shaking her head. &#8220;Besides, you know both
Mrs. Polk and Mrs. Frieze are widows, and will
be looking for husbands. We&#8217;d maybe lose some
of the best boys we&#8217;ve got, if they came here,&#8221; said
Helen, her eyes twinkling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great jumping Jehosaphat! I never thought
of that,&#8221; declared the foreman, suddenly scared.
&#8220;I never <i>did</i> like that Polk woman&#8217;s eye. I wouldn&#8217;t,
mebbe, be safe myse&#8217;f; would I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid not,&#8221; Helen gravely agreed. &#8220;So,
you see, to please dad, I&#8217;ll have to go to New
York. I don&#8217;t mean to stay for all time, Hen.
But I want to give it a try-out.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sounded Dud Stone a good bit about the
big city. Dud had to stay several days at Sunset
Ranch because he couldn&#8217;t ride very well
with his injured foot. And finally, when he did
go back to Badger&#8217;s, they took him in a buckboard.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, Dud was not altogether glad
to go. He was a boyish chap despite the fact that
he was nearly through law school, and a sixteen-year-old
girl like Helen Morrell&mdash;especially one of
her character&mdash;appealed to him strongly.</p>
<p>He admired the capable way in which she managed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
things about the ranch-house. Sing obeyed
her as though she were a man. There was a &#8220;rag-head&#8221;
who had somehow worked his way across
the mountains from the coast, and that Hindoo
about worshipped &#8220;Missee Sahib.&#8221; The two or
three Greasers working about the ranch showed
their teeth in broad smiles, and bowed most politely
when she appeared. And as for the punchers
and wranglers, they were every one as loyal
to Snuggy as they had been to her father.</p>
<p>The Easterner realized that among all the girls
he knew back home, either of her age or older,
there was none so capable as Helen Morrell. And
there were few any prettier.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going right to relatives when you reach
New York; are you, Miss Morrell?&#8221; asked Dud,
just before he climbed into the buckboard to return
to his friend&#8217;s ranch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. I shall go to Aunt Eunice,&#8221; said the
girl, decidedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No need of my warning you against bunco men
and card sharpers,&#8221; chuckled Dud, &#8220;for your
folks will look out for you. But remember:
You&#8217;ll be just as much a tenderfoot there as I
am here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall take care,&#8221; she returned, laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;And&mdash;and I hope I may see you in New
York,&#8221; said Dud, hesitatingly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I hope we shall run across each other,&#8221;
replied Helen, calmly. She was not sure that it
would be the right thing to invite this young man
to call upon her at the Starkweathers&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d better ask Aunt Eunice about that first,&#8221;
she decided, to herself.</p>
<p>So she shook hands heartily with Dud Stone
and let him ride away, never appearing to notice
his rather wistful look. She was to see the time,
however, when she would be very glad of a friend
like Dud Stone in the great city.</p>
<p>Helen made her preparations for her trip to
New York without any advice from another
woman. To tell the truth she had little but riding
habits which were fit to wear, save the house frocks
which she wore around the ranch.</p>
<p>When she had gone to school in Denver, her
father had sent a sum of money to the principal
and that lady had seen that Helen was dressed
tastefully and well. But all these garments she
had outgrown.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, Helen had spent little of her
time in studying the pictures in fashion magazines.
In fact, there were no such books about
Sunset Ranch.</p>
<p>The girl realized that the rough and ready
frocks she possessed were not in style. There was
but one store in Elberon, the nearest town, where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
ready-to-wear garments were sold. She went there
and purchased the best they had; but they left
much to be desired.</p>
<p>She got a brown dress to travel in, and a shirtwaist
or two; but beyond that she dared not go.
Helen was wise enough to realize that, after she
arrived at her Uncle Starkweather&#8217;s, it would be
time enough to purchase proper raiment.</p>
<p>She &#8220;dressed up&#8221; in the new frock for the boys
to admire, the evening before she left. Every man
who could be spared from the range&mdash;even as far
as Creeping Ford&mdash;came in to the &#8220;party.&#8221; They
all admired Helen and were sorry to see her go
away. Yet they gave her their best wishes.</p>
<p>Big Hen Billings rode part of the way to Elberon
with her in the morning. She was going
to send the strawberry roan back hitched behind
the supply wagon. Her riding dress she would
change in the station agent&#8217;s parlor for the new
dress which was in the tray of her small trunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep yer eyes peeled, Snuggy,&#8221; advised the
old foreman, with gravity, &#8220;when ye come up
against that New York town. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t like Elberon&mdash;no,
sir! &#8217;Tain&#8217;t even like Helena.</p>
<p>&#8220;Them folks in New York is rubbing up against
each other so close, that it makes &#8217;em moughty
sharp&mdash;yessir! Jumping Jehosaphat! I knowed
a feller that went there onct and he lost ten dollars
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
and his watch before he&#8217;d been off the train an
hour. They can do ye that quick!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that fellow must have been <i>you</i>,
Hen,&#8221; declared Helen, laughing.</p>
<p>The foreman looked shamefaced. &#8220;Wal, it
were,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;But they never got nothin&#8217;
more out o&#8217; me. It was the hottest kind o&#8217; summer
weather&mdash;an&#8217; lemme tell yuh, it can be some
hot in that man&#8217;s town.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, I had a sheepskin coat with me. I put
it on, and I buttoned it from my throat-latch down
to my boot-tops. They&#8217;d had to pry a dollar
out o&#8217; my pocket with a crowbar, and I wouldn&#8217;t
have had a drink with the mayor of the city if
he&#8217;d invited me. No, sirree, sir!&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen laughed again. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you fear for me,
Hen. I shall be in the best of hands, and shall
have plenty of friends around me. I&#8217;ll never feel
lonely in New York, I am sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope not. But, Snuggy, you know what to
do if anything goes wrong. Just telegraph me.
If you want me to come on, say the word&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Hen! How ridiculous you talk,&#8221; she
cried. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be with relatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ya-as. I know,&#8221; said the giant, shaking his
head. &#8220;But relatives ain&#8217;t like them that&#8217;s
knowed and loved yuh all yuh life. Don&#8217;t forgit
us out yere, Snuggy&mdash;and if ye want anything&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
His heart was evidently too full for further
utterance. He jerked his pony&#8217;s head around,
waved his hand to the girl who likewise was all but
in tears, and dashed back over the trail toward
Sunset Ranch.</p>
<p>Helen pulled the Rose pony&#8217;s head around and
jogged on, headed east.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>AT BOTH ENDS OF THE ROUTE</h3>
</div>

<p>As Helen walked up and down the platform at
Elberon, waiting for the east-bound Transcontinental,
she looked to be a very plain country girl
with nothing in her dress to denote that she was
one of the wealthiest young women in the State of
Montana.</p>
<p>Sunset Ranch was one of the few remaining
great cattle ranches of the West. Her father
could justly have been called &#8220;a cattle king,&#8221; only
Prince Morrell was not the sort of man who likes
to see his name in print.</p>
<p>Indeed, there was a good reason why Helen&#8217;s
father had not wished to advertise himself. That
old misfortune, which had borne so heavily upon
his mind and heart when he came to die, had made
him shrink from publicity.</p>
<p>However, business at Sunset Ranch had prospered
both before and since Mr. Morrell&#8217;s death.
The money had rolled in and the bank accounts
which had been put under the administration of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
Big Hen Billings and the lawyer at Elberon, increased
steadily.</p>
<p>Big Hen was a generous-handed administrator
and guardian. Of course, the foreman of the
ranch was, perhaps, not the best person to be
guardian of a sixteen-year-old girl. He did not
treat her, in regard to money matters, as the ordinary
guardian would have treated a ward.</p>
<p>Big Hen didn&#8217;t know how to limit a girl&#8217;s expenditures;
but he knew how to treat a man right.
And he treated Helen Morrell just as though she
were a sane and responsible man.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a thousand dollars in cash for you,
Snuggy,&#8221; he had said. &#8220;I got it in soft money, for
it&#8217;s a fac&#8217; that they use that stuff a good deal in the
East. Besides, the hard money would have made
a good deal of a load for you to tote in them leetle
war-bags of yourn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But shall I ever need a thousand dollars?&#8221;
asked Helen, doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know. Can&#8217;t tell. Sometimes ye need
money when ye least expect it. Ye needn&#8217;t tell
anybody how much you&#8217;ve got. Only, it&#8217;s <i>there</i>&mdash;and
a full pocket is a mighty nice backin&#8217; for anybody
to have.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if ye find any time ye want more, jest
telegraph. We&#8217;ll send ye what they call a draft
for all ye want. Cut a dash. Show &#8217;em that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
the girl from Sunset Ranch is the real thing,
Snuggy.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she had only laughed at this. It never
entered Helen Morrell&#8217;s mind that she should ever
wish to &#8220;cut a dash&#8221; before her relatives in New
York.</p>
<p>She had filed a telegram to Mr. Willets Starkweather,
on Madison Avenue, before the train arrived,
saying that she was coming. She hoped
that her relatives would reply and she would get
the reply en route.</p>
<p>When her father died, she had written to
the Starkweathers. She had received a brief, but
kindly worded note from Uncle Starkweather.
And it had scarcely been time yet, so Helen
thought, for Aunt Eunice or the girls to write.</p>
<p>But could Helen have arrived at the Madison
Avenue mansion of Willets Starkweather at the
same hour her message arrived and heard the
family&#8217;s comments on it, it is very doubtful if she
would have swung herself aboard the parlor car
of the Transcontinental, without the porter&#8217;s help,
and sought her seat.</p>
<p>The Starkweathers lived in very good style, indeed.
The mansion was one of several remaining
in that section, all occupied by the very oldest
and most elevated socially of New York&#8217;s solid
families. They were not people whose names
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
appeared in the gossip columns of the papers to
any extent; but to live in their neighborhood, and
to meet them socially, was sufficient to insure one&#8217;s
welcome anywhere.</p>
<p>The Starkweather mansion had descended to
Willets Starkweather with the money&mdash;all from
his great-uncle&mdash;which had finally put the family
upon its feet. When Prince Morrell had left New
York under a cloud, his brother-in-law was a
struggling merchant himself.</p>
<p>Now, in sixteen years, he had practically retired.
At least, he was no longer &#8220;in trade.&#8221; He
merely went to an office, or to his broker&#8217;s, each
day, and watched his investments and his real
estate holdings.</p>
<p>A pompous, well-fed man was Willets Starkweather&mdash;and
always imposingly dressed. He
was very bald, wore a closely cropped gray beard,
eyeglasses, and &#8220;Ahem!&#8221; was an introduction
to almost everything he said. That clearing
of the bronchial tubes was an announcement to
the listening world that he, Willets Starkweather,
of Madison Avenue, was about to make a remark.
And no matter how trivial that remark might be,
coming from the lips of the great man, it should
be pondered upon and regarded with awe.</p>
<p>Mr. Starkweather was a widower. Helen&#8217;s
Aunt Eunice had been dead three years. It had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
never been considered necessary by either Mr.
Starkweather, or his daughters, to write &#8220;Aunt
Mary&#8217;s folks in Montana&#8221; of Mrs. Starkweather&#8217;s
death.</p>
<p>Correspondence between the families had ceased
at the time of Mrs. Morrell&#8217;s death. The Starkweather
girls understood that Aunt Mary&#8217;s husband
had &#8220;done something&#8221; before he left New
York for the wild and woolly West. The family
did not&mdash;Ahem!&mdash;speak of him.</p>
<p>The three girls were respectively eighteen, sixteen,
and fourteen. Even Flossie considered herself
entirely grown up. She attended a private
school not far from Central Park, and went each
day dressed as elaborately as a matron of thirty.</p>
<p>For Hortense, who was just Helen Morrell&#8217;s
age, &#8220;school had become a bore.&#8221; She had a
smattering of French, knew how to drum nicely
on the piano&mdash;she was still taking lessons in <i>that</i>
polite accomplishment&mdash;had only a vague idea of
the ordinary rules of English grammar, and couldn&#8217;t
write a decent letter, or spell words of more
than two syllables, to save her life.</p>
<p>Belle golfed. She did little else just now, for
she was a creature of fads. Occasionally she got
a new one, and with kindred spirits played that
particular fad to death.</p>
<p>She might have found a much worse hobby to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
ride. Getting up early and starting for the Long
Island links, or for Westchester, before her sisters
had had their breakfast, was not doing Belle
a bit of harm. Only, she was getting in with a
somewhat &#8220;sporty&#8221; class of girls and women
older than herself, and the bloom of youth had
been quite rubbed off.</p>
<p>Indeed, these three girls were about as fresh as
is a dried prune. They had jumped from childhood
into full-blown womanhood (or thought they
had), thereby missing the very best and sweetest
part of their girls&#8217; life.</p>
<p>They had come in from their various activities
of the day when Helen&#8217;s telegram arrived. Naturally
they ran with it to their father&#8217;s &#8220;den&#8221;&mdash;a
gorgeously upholstered yet small library on the
ground floor, at the back.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it now, girls?&#8221; demanded Mr. Starkweather,
looking up in some dismay at this general
onslaught. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to suggest any further
expenditures this month. I have paid all the
bills I possibly can pay. We must retrench&mdash;we
must retrench.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Pa!&#8221; said Flossie, saucily, &#8220;you&#8217;re always
saying that. I believe you say &#8216;We must retrench!&#8217;
in your sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And small wonder if I do,&#8221; he grumbled.
&#8220;I have lost some money; the stock market is very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
dull. And nobody is buying real estate. I&mdash;I am
quite at my wits&#8217; ends, I assure you, girls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me! and another mouth to feed!&#8221;
laughed Hortense, tossing her head. &#8220;<i>That</i> will
be excuse enough for telling her to go to a hotel
when she arrives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably the poor thing won&#8217;t have the price
of a room,&#8221; observed Belle, looking again at the
telegram.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that in your hand, child?&#8221; demanded
Mr. Starkweather, suddenly seeing the yellow slip
of paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;A dispatch, Pa,&#8221; said Flossie, snatching it out
of Belle&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;A telegram?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;d never guess from whom,&#8221; cried the
youngest girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;Let me see it,&#8221; said her father, with
some abruptness. &#8220;No bad news, I hope?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t call it <i>good</i> news,&#8221; said the oldest
girl, with a sniff.</p>
<p>Mr. Starkweather read it aloud:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style=' margin-left:4em;'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;Coming on Transcontinental. Arrive Grand</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Central Terminal 9 P.M. the third.</p>
<br />
<p  style='text-align: right;'>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Helen Morrell</span>.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;Now! What do you think of that, Pa?&#8221; demanded
Flossie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Helen Morrell,&#8217;&#8221; repeated Mr. Starkweather,
and a person more observant than any
of his daughters might have seen that his lips had
grown suddenly gray. He dropped into his chair
rather heavily. &#8220;Your cousin, girls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fol-de-rol!&#8221; exclaimed Belle. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see
why she should claim relationship.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Send her to a hotel, Pa,&#8221; said Flossie.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure <i>I</i> do not wish to be bothered by a
common ranch girl. Why! she was born and
brought up out in the wilds; wasn&#8217;t she?&#8221; demanded
Hortense.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her father and mother went West before this
girl was born&mdash;yes,&#8221; murmured Mr. Starkweather.</p>
<p>He was strangely agitated by the message. But
the girls did not notice this. They were not likely
to notice anything but their own disturbance over
the coming of &#8220;that ranch girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Pa, we can&#8217;t have her here!&#8221; cried
Belle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course we can&#8217;t, Pa,&#8221; agreed Hortense.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure <i>I</i> don&#8217;t want the common little thing
around,&#8221; added Flossie, who, as has been said,
was quite two years Helen&#8217;s junior.</p>
<p>&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t introduce her to our friends,&#8221;
declared Belle.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a <i>fright</i> she&#8217;ll be!&#8221; wailed Hortense.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll wear a sombrero and a split riding skirt,
I suppose,&#8221; scoffed Flossie, who madly desired a
slit skirt, herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course she&#8217;ll be a perfect dowdy,&#8221; Belle
observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;And be loud and wear heavy boots, and stamp
through the house,&#8221; sighed Hortense. &#8220;We just
<i>can&#8217;t</i> have her, Pa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I wouldn&#8217;t let any of the girls of <i>our</i>
set see her for the world,&#8221; cried Flossie.</p>
<p>Their father finally spoke. He had recovered
from his secret emotion, but he was still mopping
the perspiration from his bald brow.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really see how I can prevent her coming,&#8221;
he said, rather weakly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What nonsense, Pa!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you can!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Telegraph her not to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But she is already aboard the train,&#8221; objected
Mr. Starkweather, gloomily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, I tell you,&#8221; snapped Flossie, who was
the most unkind of the girls. &#8220;Don&#8217;t telegraph
her at all. Don&#8217;t answer her message. Don&#8217;t send
to the station to meet her. Maybe she won&#8217;t be
too dense to take <i>that</i> hint.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh! these wild and woolly Western girls!&#8221;
grumbled Hortense. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe she&#8217;ll know
enough to stay away.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We can try it,&#8221; persisted Flossie.</p>
<p>&#8220;She ought to realize that we&#8217;re not dying to
see her when we don&#8217;t come to the train,&#8221; said
Belle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;don&#8217;t&mdash;know,&#8221; mused their father.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Pa!&#8221; cried Flossie. &#8220;You know very
well you don&#8217;t want that girl here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;But&mdash;Ahem!&mdash;we have
certain duties&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bother duties!&#8221; said Hortense.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahem! She is your mother&#8217;s sister&#8217;s child,&#8221;
spoke Mr. Starkweather, heavily. &#8220;She is a young
and unprotected female&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems to me,&#8221; said Belle, crossly, &#8220;the relationship
is far enough removed for us to ignore it.
Mother&#8217;s sister, Aunt Mary, is dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True&mdash;true. Ahem!&#8221; said her father.</p>
<p>&#8220;And isn&#8217;t it true that this man, Morrell, whom
she married, left New York under a cloud?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O&mdash;oh!&#8221; cried Hortense. &#8220;So he did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he do?&#8221; Flossie asked, bluntly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Embezzled; didn&#8217;t he, Pa?&#8221; asked Belle.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough!&#8221; cried Flossie, tossing her
head. &#8220;We certainly don&#8217;t want a convict&#8217;s
daughter in the house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, Flossie!&#8221; said her father, with sudden
sternness. &#8220;Prince Morrell was never a convict.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; sneered Hortense. &#8220;He ran away. He
didn&#8217;t get that far.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahem! Daughters, we have no right to talk
in this way&mdash;even in fun&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; cried Belle, impatiently.
&#8220;Whether she&#8217;s a criminal&#8217;s child or not; I don&#8217;t
want her. None of us wants her. Why, then,
should we have her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But where will she go?&#8221; demanded Mr.
Starkweather, almost desperately.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do we care?&#8221; cried Flossie, callously.
&#8220;She can be sent back; can&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you what it is,&#8221; said Belle, getting up
and speaking with determination. &#8220;We don&#8217;t
want Helen Morrell here. We will not meet her
at the train. We will not send any reply to this
message from her. And if she has the effrontery
to come here to the house after our ignoring her in
this way, we&#8217;ll send her back where she came from
just as soon as it can be done. What do you say,
girls?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; from Hortense and Flossie.</p>
<p>But their father said &#8220;Ahem!&#8221; and still looked
troubled.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>ACROSS THE CONTINENT</h3>
</div>

<p>It was not as though Helen Morrell had never
been in a train before. Eight times she had gone
back and forth to Denver, and she had always
ridden in the best style. So sleepers, chair cars,
private compartments, and observation coaches
were no novelty to her.</p>
<p>She had discussed the matter with her friend,
the Elberon station agent, and had bought her
ticket through to New York, with a berth section
to herself. It cost a good bit of money, but Helen
knew no better way to spend some of that thousand
dollars that Big Hen had given to her.</p>
<p>Her small trunk was put in the baggage car,
and all she carried was a hand-satchel with toilet
articles and kimono; and in it likewise was her father&#8217;s
big wallet stuffed with the yellow-backed
notes&mdash;all crisp and new&mdash;that Big Hen Billings
had brought to her from the bank.</p>
<p>When she was comfortably seated in her particular
section, and the porter had seen that her
footstool was right, and had hovered about her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
with offers of other assistance until she had put
a silver dollar into his itching palm, Helen first
stared about her frankly at the other occupants of
the car.</p>
<p>Nobody paid much attention to the countrified
girl who had come aboard at the way-station. The
Transcontinental&#8217;s cars are always well filled.
There were family parties, and single tourists, with
part of a grand opera troupe, and traveling men
of the better class.</p>
<p>Helen would have been glad to join one of the
family groups. In one there were two girls and
a boy beside the parents and a lady who must have
been the governess. One of the girls, and the boy,
were quite as old as Helen. They were all so well
behaved, and polite to each other, yet jolly and
companionable, that Helen knew she could have
liked them immensely.</p>
<p>But there was nobody to introduce the lonely
girl to them, nor to any others of her fellow
travelers. The conductor, even, did not take much
interest in the girl in brown.</p>
<p>She began to realize that what was the height
of fashion in Elberon was several seasons behind
the style in larger communities. There was not
a pretty or attractive thing about Helen&#8217;s dress;
and even a very pretty girl will seem a frump in
an out-of-style and unbecoming frock.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>It might have been better for the girl from Sunset
Ranch if she had worn on the train the very
riding habit she had in her trunk. At least, it
would have become her and she would have felt
natural in it.</p>
<p>She knew now&mdash;when she had seen the hats of
her fellow passengers&mdash;that her own was an
atrocity. And, then, Helen had &#8220;put her hair up,&#8221;
which was something she had not been used to
doing. Without practice, or some example to
work by, how could this unsophisticated young
girl have produced a specimen of modern hair-dressing
fit to be seen?</p>
<p>Even Dudley Stone could not have thought
Helen Morrell pretty as she looked now. And
when she gazed in the glass herself, the girl from
Sunset Ranch was more than a little disgusted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know I&#8217;m a fright. I&#8217;ve got &#8216;such a muchness&#8217;
of hair and it&#8217;s so sunburned, and all! What
those girls I&#8217;m going to see will say to me, I don&#8217;t
know. But if they&#8217;re good-natured they&#8217;ll soon
show me how to handle this mop&mdash;and of course
I can buy any quantity of pretty frocks when I
get to New York.&#8221;</p>
<p>So she only looked at the other people on the
train and made no acquaintances at all that first
day. She slept soundly at night while the Transcontinental
raced on over the undulating plains on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
which the stars shone so peacefully. Each roll
of the drumming wheels was carrying her nearer
and nearer to that new world of which she knew
so little, but from which she hoped so much.</p>
<p>She dreamed that she had reached her goal&mdash;Uncle
Starkweather&#8217;s house. Aunt Eunice met
her. She had never even seen a photograph of
her aunt; but the lady who gathered her so closely
into her arms and kissed her so tenderly, looked
just as Helen&#8217;s own mother had looked.</p>
<p>She awoke crying, and hugging the tiny pillow
which the Pullman Company furnishes its patrons
as a sample&mdash;the <i>real</i> pillow never materializes.</p>
<p>But to the healthy girl from the wide reaches
of the Montana range, the berth was quite comfortable
enough. She had slept on the open
ground many a night, rolled only in a blanket and
without any pillow at all. So she arose fresher
than most of her fellow-passengers.</p>
<p>One man&mdash;whom she had noticed the evening
before&mdash;was adjusting a wig behind the curtain of
his section. He looked when he was completely
dressed rather a well-preserved person; and Helen
was impressed with the thought that he must still
feel young to wish to appear so juvenile.</p>
<p>Even with his wig adjusted&mdash;a very curly brown
affair&mdash;the man looked, however, to be upward of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
sixty. There were many fine wrinkles about his
eyes and deep lines graven in his cheeks.</p>
<p>His section was just behind that of the girl from
Sunset Ranch, on the other side of the car. After
returning from the breakfast table this first morning
Helen thought she would better take a little
more money out of the wallet to put in her purse
for emergencies on the train. So she opened the
locked bag and dragged out the well-stuffed wallet
from underneath her other possessions.</p>
<p>The roll of yellow-backed notes <i>was</i> a large one.
Helen, lacking more interesting occupation, unfolded
the crisp banknotes and counted them to
make sure of her balance. As she sat in her seat
she thought nobody could observe her.</p>
<p>Then she withdrew what she thought she might
need, and put the remainder of the money back
into the old wallet, snapped the strong elastic about
it, and slid it down to the bottom of the bag again.</p>
<p>The key of the bag she carried on the chain
with her locket, which locket contained the miniatures
of her mother and father. Key and locket
she hid in the bosom of her dress.</p>
<p>She looked up suddenly. There was the fatherly-looking
old person almost bending over her chair
back. For an instant the girl was very much
startled. The old man&#8217;s eyes were wonderfully
keen and twinkling, and there was an expression
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
in them which Helen at first did not understand.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have finished with that magazine, my
dear, I&#8217;ll exchange it for one of mine,&#8221; said the
old gentleman coolly. &#8220;What! did I frighten
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly, sir,&#8221; returned Helen, watching
him curiously. &#8220;But I <i>was</i> startled.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Beg pardon. You do not look like a young
person who would be easily frightened,&#8221; he said,
laughing. &#8220;You are traveling alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Far?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To New York, sir,&#8221; said Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! a long way for a girl to go by herself&mdash;even
a self-possessed one like you,&#8221; said the fatherly
old fellow. &#8220;I hope you have friends to
meet you there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Relatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have never been there, I take it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never been farther east than Denver
before,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed! And so you have not met the relatives
you are going to?&#8221; he suggested, shrewdly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, of course, they will not fail to meet
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I telegraphed to them. I expect to get a
reply somewhere on the way.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then you are well provided for,&#8221; said the old
gentleman, kindly. &#8220;Yet, if you should need any
assistance&mdash;of any kind&mdash;do not fail to call upon
me. I am going through to New York, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went back to his seat after making the exchange
of magazines, and did not force his attentions
upon her further. He was, however, almost
the only person who spoke to her all the way
across the continent.</p>
<p>Frequently they ate together at the same table,
both being alone. He bought newspapers and
magazines and exchanged with her. He never became
personal and asked her questions again, nor
did Helen learn his name; but in little ways which
were not really objectionable, he showed that he
took an interest in her. There remained, however,
the belief in Helen&#8217;s mind that he had seen her
counting the money.</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect I&#8217;d like the old chap if he didn&#8217;t wear
a wig,&#8221; thought Helen. &#8220;I never could see why
people wished to hide the mistakes of Nature.
And he&#8217;s an old gentleman, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet again and again she recalled that avaricious
gleam in his eyes and how eager he had seemed
when she had first caught sight of his face looking
over her shoulder that first morning on the
train. She couldn&#8217;t forget that. She kept the
locked bag near her hand all the time.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>With lively company a journey across this great
continent of ours is a cheerful and inspiring experience.
And, of course, Youth can never remain
depressed for long. But in Helen Morrell&#8217;s case
the trip could not be counted as an enjoyable one.</p>
<p>She was always solitary amid the crowd of
travelers. Even when she went back to the observation
platform she was alone. She had nobody
with whom to discuss the beauties of the landscape,
or the wonders of Nature past which the
train flashed.</p>
<p>This was her own fault to a degree, of course.
The girl from Sunset Ranch was diffident. These
people aboard were all Easterners, or foreigners.
There were no open-hearted, friendly Western
folk such as she had been used to all her life.</p>
<p>She felt herself among a strange people. She
scarcely spoke the same language, or so it seemed.
She had felt less awkward and bashful when she
had first gone to the school at Denver as a little
girl.</p>
<p>And, again, she was troubled because she had
received no reply from her message to Uncle Starkweather.
Of course, he might not have been at
home to receive it; but surely some of the family
must have received it.</p>
<p>Every time the brakeman, or porter, or conductor,
came through with a message for some passenger,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
she hoped he would call her name. But
the Transcontinental brought her across the Western
plains, over the two great rivers, through the
Mid-West prairies, skirted two of the Great
Lakes, rushed across the wooded and mountainous
Empire State, and finally dashed down the length
of the embattled Hudson toward the Great City
of the New World&mdash;the goal of Helen Morrell&#8217;s
late desires, with no word from the relatives whom
she so hoped would welcome her to their hearts
and home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>THE GREAT CITY</h3>
</div>

<p>Helen Morrell never forgot her initial impressions
of the great city.</p>
<p>These impressions were at first rather startling&mdash;then
intensely interesting. And they all culminated
in a single opinion which time only could
prove either true or erroneous.</p>
<p>That belief or opinion Helen expressed in an
almost audible exclamation:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why! there are so many people here one
could <i>never</i> feel lonely!&#8221;</p>
<p>This impression came to her after the train had
rolled past miles of streets&mdash;all perfectly straight,
bearing off on either hand to the two rivers that
wash Manhattan&#8217;s shores; all illuminated exactly
alike; all bordered by cliffs of dwellings seemingly
cut on the same pattern and from the same material.</p>
<p>With clasped hands and parted lips the girl from
Sunset Ranch watched eagerly the glowing streets,
parted by the rushing train. As it slowed down at
125th Street she could see far along that broad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
thoroughfare&mdash;an uptown Broadway. There
were thousands and thousands of people in sight&mdash;with
the glare of shoplights&mdash;the clanging electric
cars&mdash;the taxicabs and autos shooting across
the main stem of Harlem into the avenues running
north and south.</p>
<p>It was as marvelous to the Montana girl as the
views of a foreign land upon the screen of a moving
picture theatre. She sank back in her seat
with a sigh as the train moved on.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a wonderful, wonderful place!&#8221; she
thought. &#8220;It looks like fairyland. It is an enchanted
place&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The train, now under electric power, shot suddenly
into the ground. The tunnel was odorous
and ill-lighted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; the girl thought, &#8220;I suppose there <i>is</i>
another side to the big city, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>The passengers began to put on their wraps and
gather together their hand-luggage. There was
much talking and confusion. Some of the tourists
had been met at 125th Street by friends who came
that far to greet them.</p>
<p>But there was nobody to greet Helen. There
was nobody waiting on the platform, to come and
clasp her hand and bid her welcome, when the train
stopped.</p>
<p>She got down, with her bag, and looked about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
her. She saw that the old gentleman with the wig
kept step with her. But he did not seem to be
noticing her, and presently he disappeared.</p>
<p>The girl from Sunset Ranch walked slowly up
into the main building of the Grand Central
Terminal with the crowd. There was chattering
all about her&mdash;young voices, old voices, laughter,
squeals of delight and surprise&mdash;all the hubbub
of a homing crowd meeting a crowd of
friends.</p>
<p>And through it all Helen walked, a stranger in a
strange land.</p>
<p>She lingered, hoping that Uncle Starkweather&#8217;s
people might be late. But nobody spoke to her.
She did not know that there were matrons and
police officers in the building to whom she could
apply for advice or assistance.</p>
<p>Naturally independent, this girl of the ranges
was not likely to ask a stranger for help. She
could find her own way.</p>
<p>She smiled&mdash;yet it was a rather wry smile&mdash;when
she thought of how Dud Stone had told her
she would be as much of a tenderfoot in New
York as he had been on the plains.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fact,&#8221; she thought. &#8220;But, if they didn&#8217;t
get my message, I reckon I can find the house, just
the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having been so much in Denver she knew a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
good deal about city ways. She did not linger
about the station long.</p>
<p>Outside there was a row of taxicabs and cabmen.
There was an officer, too; but he was engaged
at the moment in helping a fussy old lady get
seven parcels, a hat box, and a dog basket into a
cab.</p>
<p>So Helen walked down the row of waiting taxicabs.
At the end cab the chauffeur on the seat
turned around and beckoned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cab, Miss? Take you anywhere you say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know where this number on Madison
Street is, of course?&#8221; she said, showing a card
with the address on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, Miss. Jump right in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How much will it be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trunk, Miss?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Here is the check.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chauffeur got out of his seat quickly and
took the check.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so much a mile. The little clock tells you
the fare,&#8221; he said, pleasantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; replied Helen. &#8220;You get the
trunk,&#8221; and she stepped into the vehicle.</p>
<p>In a few moments he was back with the trunk
and secured it on the roof of his cab. Then he
reached in and tucked a cloth around his passenger,
although the evening was not cold, and got in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
under the wheel. In another moment the taxicab
rolled out from under the roofed concourse.</p>
<p>Helen had never ridden in any vehicle that went
so smoothly and so fast. It shot right downtown,
mile after mile; but Helen was so interested in
the sights she saw from the window of the
cab that she did not worry about the time that
elapsed.</p>
<p>By and by they went under an elevated railroad
structure; the street grew more narrow and&mdash;to
tell the truth&mdash;Helen thought the place appeared
rather dirty and unkempt.</p>
<p>Then the cab was turned suddenly across the
way, under another elevated structure, and into a
narrow, noisy, ill-kept street.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can it be that Uncle Starkweather lives in
this part of the town?&#8221; thought Helen, in amazement.</p>
<p>She had always understood that the Starkweather
mansion was in one of the oldest and
most respectable parts of New York. But although
<i>this</i> might be one of the older parts of
the city, to Helen&#8217;s eyes it did <i>not</i> look respectable.</p>
<p>The street was full of children and grown people
in odd costumes. And there was a babel of
voices that certainly were not English.</p>
<p>They shot across another narrow street&mdash;then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
another. And then the cab stopped beside the
curb near a corner gaslight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely this is not Madison?&#8221; demanded
Helen, of the driver, as her door was opened.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the name, Miss,&#8221; said the man, pointing
to the street light.</p>
<p>Helen looked. She really <i>did</i> see &#8220;MADISON&#8221;
in blue letters on the sign.</p>
<p>&#8220;And is this the number?&#8221; she asked again,
looking at the three-story, shabby house before
which the cab had stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss. Don&#8217;t you see it on the fanlight?&#8221;</p>
<p>The dull light in the hall of the house was sufficient
to reveal to her the number painted on the
glass above the door. It was an old, old house,
with grimy panes in the windows, and more dull
lights behind the shades drawn down over them.
But there really could be no mistake, Helen
thought. The number over the door and the name
on the lamp-post reassured her.</p>
<p>She stepped out of the cab, her bag in her
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;See if your folks are here, Miss,&#8221; said the
driver, &#8220;before I take off the trunk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen crossed the walk, clinging to her precious
bag. She was not a little disturbed by this strange
situation. These streets about here were the commonest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
of the common! And she was carrying a
large sum of money, quite unprotected.</p>
<p>When she mounted the steps and touched the
door, it opened. A bustle of sound came from
the house; yet it was not the kind of bustle that
she had expected to hear in her uncle&#8217;s home.</p>
<p>There were the crying of children, the shrieking
of a woman&#8217;s angry voice&mdash;another singing&mdash;language
in guttural tones which she could not
understand&mdash;heavy boots tramping upon the bare
boards overhead.</p>
<p>This lower hall was unfurnished. Indeed, it was
a most unlovely place as far as Helen could see by
the light of a single flaring gas jet.</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of a place have I got into?&#8221; murmured
the Western girl, staring about in disgust
and horror, and clinging tightly to the locked bag.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE WELCOME</h3>
</div>

<p>Helen would have faced almost any peril of
the range&mdash;wolves, a bear even, a stampede, flood,
or fire&mdash;with more confidence than she felt at this
moment.</p>
<p>She had some idea of how city people lived,
having been to school in Denver. It seemed impossible
that Uncle Starkweather and his family
could reside in such a place as this. And yet the
street and number were correct. Surely, the taxicab
driver must know his way about the city!</p>
<p>From behind the door on her right came the
rattle of dishes and voices. Putting her courage
to the test, Helen rapped on the door. But she
had to repeat the summons before she was heard.</p>
<p>Then she heard a shuffling step approach the
door, it was unlocked, and a gray old woman, with
a huge horsehair wig upon her head, peered out at
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vot you vant?&#8221; this apparition asked, her
black eyes growing round in wonder at the appearance
of the girl and her bag. &#8220;Ve puys
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
noddings; ve sells noddings. Vot you vant&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am looking for my Uncle Starkweather,&#8221;
said Helen, doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vor your ungle?&#8221; repeated the old woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Starkweather. Does he live in this
house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;S&#8217;arkwesser&#8217;? I neffer heard,&#8221; said the old
woman, shaking her huge head. &#8220;Abramovitch
lifs here, and Abelosky, and Seldt, and&mdash;and
Goronsky. You sure you god de name ride,
Miss?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite sure,&#8221; replied the puzzled Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meppe ubstairs,&#8221; said the woman, eyeing
Helen curiously. &#8220;Vot you god in de pag, lady?&#8221;</p>
<p>To tell the truth this query rather frightened
the girl. She did not reply to the question, but
started half-blindly for the stairs, clinging to the
bag with both hands.</p>
<p>Suddenly a door banged above and a quick and
light step began to descend the upper flight. Helen
halted and looked expectantly upward. The approaching
step was that of a young person.</p>
<p>In a moment a girl appeared, descending the
stairs like a young whirlwind. She was a vigorous,
red-cheeked girl, with dark complexion, a prominent
nose, flashing black eyes, and plump, sturdy
arms bared to her dimpled elbows. She saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
Helen there in the hall and stopped, questioningly.
The old woman said something to the newcomer
in what Helen supposed must be Yiddish,
and banged shut her own door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whaddeyer want, Miss?&#8221; asked the dark
girl, coming nearer to Helen and smiling, showing
two rows of perfect teeth. &#8220;Got lost?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know but what I have,&#8221; admitted the
girl from the West.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chee! You&#8217;re a greenie, too; ain&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon so,&#8221; replied Helen, smiling in return.
&#8220;At least, I&#8217;ve just arrived in town.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl had now opened the door and looked
out. &#8220;Look at this, now!&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;Did you come in that taxi?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; admitted Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chee! you&#8217;re some swell; aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; said
the other. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have them things stopping
at the house every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am looking for my uncle, Mr. Willets Starkweather.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s no Jewish name. I don&#8217;t believe he
lives in this house,&#8221; said the black-eyed girl, curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, this is the number&mdash;I saw it,&#8221; said Helen,
faintly. &#8220;And it&#8217;s Madison Avenue; isn&#8217;t it? I
saw the name on the corner lamp-post.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Madison Avenyer?</i>&#8221; gasped the other girl.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yer kiddin&#8217;; ain&#8217;t yer?&#8221; demanded the
stranger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;&mdash; What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This ain&#8217;t Madison Avenyer,&#8221; said the black-eyed
girl, with a loud laugh. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t you the
greenie? Why, this is Madison <i>Street!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, then, there&#8217;s a difference?&#8221; cried Helen,
much relieved. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t get to Uncle Starkweather&#8217;s,
then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if he lives on Madison Avenyer,&#8221; said her
new friend. &#8220;What&#8217;s his number? I got a cousin
that married a man in Harlem. <i>She</i> lives
on Madison Avenyer; but it&#8217;s a long ways up
town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Uncle Starkweather has his home at the
same number on Madison Avenue that is on that
fanlight,&#8221; and Helen pointed over the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he&#8217;s some swell; eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I guess so,&#8221; admitted Helen, doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;D&#8217;jer jest come to town?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And told the taxi driver to come down here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;ll take you back. I&#8217;ll take the number
of the cab and scare him pretty near into a
fit,&#8221; said the black-eyed girl, laughing. &#8220;Then
he&#8217;s sure to take you right to your uncle&#8217;s house.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m a thousand times obliged!&#8221; cried
Helen. &#8220;I <i>am</i> a tenderfoot; am I not?&#8221; and she
laughed.</p>
<p>The girl looked at her curiously. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know much about tender feet. Mine never bother
me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But I could see right away that
you didn&#8217;t belong in this part of town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve been real kind to me,&#8221; Helen
said. &#8220;I hope I&#8217;ll see you again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not likely,&#8221; said the other, shaking her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you livin&#8217; on Madison Avenyer, and me
on Madison Street?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can come down to see you,&#8221; said Helen,
frankly. &#8220;My name is Helen Morrell. What&#8217;s
yours?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sadie Goronsky. You see, I&#8217;m a Russian,&#8221;
and she smiled. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t know it by the
way I talk; would you? I learned English over
there. But some folks in Russia don&#8217;t care to mix
much with our people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about that,&#8221; said
Helen. &#8220;But I know when I like a person. And
I&#8217;ve got reason for liking you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That goes&mdash;double,&#8221; returned the other,
warmly. &#8220;I bet you come from a place far away
from this city.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Montana,&#8221; said Helen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t up in United States geography. But
I know there&#8217;s a big country the other side of the
North River.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen laughed. &#8220;I come from a good ways
beyond the river,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll have to get back to the store. Old
Jacob will give me fits.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! and I&#8217;m keeping you,&#8221; cried Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should worry!&#8221; exploded the other, slangily.
&#8220;I&#8217;m only a &#8216;puller-in.&#8217; I ain&#8217;t a saleslady. Come
on and I&#8217;ll throw a scare into that taxi-driver.
Watch me.&#8221;</p>
<p>This sort of girl was a revelation to Helen.
She was frankly independent herself; but Sadie
Goronsky showed an entirely different sort of independence.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here you, Mr. Man!&#8221; exclaimed the Jewish
girl, attracting the attention of the taxicab
driver, who had not left his seat. &#8220;Whadderyer
mean by bringing this young lady down here to
Madison Street when with half an eye you could
ha&#8217; told that she belonged on Madison <i>Avenyer</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heh?&#8221; grunted the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t play no greenie trick with <i>me</i>,&#8221;
commanded Sadie. &#8220;I gotcher number, and I
know the company youse woik for. You take this
young lady right to the correct address on the
avenyer&mdash;and see that she don&#8217;t get robbed before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
you get her there. You get in, Miss Morrell.
Don&#8217;t you be afraid. This chap won&#8217;t dare take
you anywhere but to your uncle&#8217;s house now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She said Madison Street,&#8221; declared the taxicab
driver, doggedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now <i>I</i> says Madison Avenyer!&#8221; exclaimed
Sadie. &#8220;Get in, Miss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But where&#8217;ll I find you, Sadie?&#8221; asked the
Western girl, holding the rough hand of her new
friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right at that shop yonder,&#8221; said the black-eyed
girl, pointing to a store only two doors beyond
the house which Helen had entered.
&#8220;Ladies&#8217; garments. You&#8217;ll see me pullin&#8217; &#8217;em in.
If you <i>don&#8217;t</i> see me, ask for Miss Goronsky.
Good-night, Miss! You&#8217;ll get to your uncle&#8217;s all
right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The taxicab driver had started the machine
again. They darted off through a side street, and
soon came out upon the broader thoroughfare
down which they had come so swiftly. She saw by
a street sign that it was the Bowery.</p>
<p>The man slowed down and spoke to her through
the tube.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you don&#8217;t bear no ill-will, Miss,&#8221; he
said, humbly enough. &#8220;You said Madison&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. See if you can take me to the right
place now,&#8221; returned Helen, brusquely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></p>
<p>Her talk with Sadie Goronsky had given her
more confidence. She was awake to the wiles of
the city now. Dud Stone had been right. Even
Big Hen Billings&#8217;s warnings were well placed. A
stranger like herself had to be on the lookout all
the time.</p>
<p>After a time the taxicab turned up a wider
thoroughfare that had no elevated trains roaring
overhead. At Twenty-third Street it turned west
and then north again at Madison Square.</p>
<p>There was a little haze in the air&mdash;an October
haze. Through this the lamps twinkled blithely.
There were people on the dusky benches, and many
on the walks strolling to and fro, although it was
now growing quite late.</p>
<p>In the park she caught a glimpse of water in a
fountain, splashing high, then low, with a rainbow
in it. Altogether it was a beautiful sight.</p>
<p>The hum of night traffic&mdash;the murmur of voices&mdash;they
flashed past a theatre just sending forth
its audience&mdash;and all the subdued sights and sounds
of the city delighted her again.</p>
<p>Suddenly the taxicab stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the number, Miss,&#8221; said the driver.</p>
<p>Helen looked out first. Not much like the
same number on Madison Street!</p>
<p>This block was a slice of old-fashioned New
York. On either side was a row of handsome,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
plain old houses, a few with lanterns at their steps,
and some with windows on several floors brilliantly
lighted.</p>
<p>There were carriages and automobiles waiting
at these doors. Evening parties were evidently in
progress.</p>
<p>The house before which the taxicab had stopped
showed no light in front, however, except at the
door and in one or two of the basement windows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this the place you want?&#8221; asked the driver,
with some impatience.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see,&#8221; said Helen, and hopped out of the
cab.</p>
<p>She ran boldly up the steps and rang the bell.
In a minute the inner door swung open; but the
outer grating remained locked. A man in livery
stood in the opening.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you wish, ma&#8217;am?&#8221; he asked in a
perfectly placid voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does Mr. Willets Starkweather reside here?&#8221;
asked Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Starkweather is not at home, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! then he could not have received my telegram!&#8221;
gasped Helen.</p>
<p>The footman remained silent, but partly closed
the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any message, ma&#8217;am?&#8221; he asked, perfunctorily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But surely the family is at home?&#8221; cried
Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at this hour of the hevening, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; declared
the English servant, with plain disdain.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I must see them!&#8221; cried Helen, again.
&#8220;I am Mr. Starkweather&#8217;s niece. I have come all
the way from Montana, and have just got into the
city. You must let me in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi &#8217;ave no orders regarding you, ma&#8217;am,&#8221;
declared the footman, slowly. &#8220;Mr. Starkweather
is at &#8217;is club. The young ladies are hat
an evening haffair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But auntie&mdash;surely there must be <i>somebody</i>
here to welcome me?&#8221; said Helen, in more wonder
than anger as yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may come in, Miss,&#8221; said the footman at
last. &#8220;Hi will speak to the &#8217;ousekeeper&mdash;though
I fear she is abed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I have the taxicab driver to pay, and my
trunk is here,&#8221; declared Helen, beginning suddenly
to feel very helpless.</p>
<p>The man had opened the grilled door. He
gazed down at the cab and shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait hand see Mrs. Olstrom, first, Miss,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>She stepped in. He closed both doors and
chained the inner one. He pointed to a hard seat
in a corner of the hall and then stepped softly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
away upon the thick carpet to the rear of the
premises, leaving the girl from Sunset Ranch
alone.</p>
<p><i>This</i> was her welcome to the home of her only
relatives, and to the heart of the great city!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE GHOST WALK</h3>
</div>

<p>Helen had to wait only a short time; but during
that wait she was aware that she was being
watched by a pair of bright eyes at a crevice between
the portières at the end of the hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;They act as though I came to rob them,&#8221;
thought the girl from the ranch, sitting in the
gloomy hall with the satchel at her feet.</p>
<p>This was not the welcome she had expected
when she started East. Could it be possible that
her message to Uncle Starkweather had not been
delivered? Otherwise, how could this situation be
explained?</p>
<p>Such a thing as inhospitality could not be
imagined by Helen Morrell. A begging Indian
was never turned away from Sunset Ranch. A
perfect stranger&mdash;even a sheepman&mdash;would be
hospitably treated in Montana.</p>
<p>The soft patter of the footman&#8217;s steps soon
sounded and the sharp eyes disappeared. There
was a moment&#8217;s whispering behind the curtain.
Then the liveried Englishman appeared.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Will you step this way, Miss?&#8221; he said,
gravely. &#8220;Mrs. Olstrom will see you in her sitting-room.
Leave your bag there, Miss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I guess I&#8217;ll hold onto it,&#8221; she said, aloud.</p>
<p>The footman looked pained, but said nothing.
He led the way haughtily into the rear of the
premises again. At a door he knocked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in!&#8221; said a sharp voice, and Helen was
ushered into the presence of a female with a face
quite in keeping with the tone of her voice.</p>
<p>The lady was of uncertain age. She wore a
cap, but it did not entirely hide the fact that her
thin, straw-colored hair was done up in curl-papers.
She was vinegary of feature, her light blue eyes
were as sharp as gimlets, and her lips were continually
screwed up into the expression of one
determined to say &#8220;prunes.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sat in a straight-backed chair in the sitting-room,
in a flowered silk bed-wrapper, and she
looked just as glad to see Helen as though the girl
were her deadliest enemy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Helen Morrell,&#8221; said the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want of Mr. Starkweather at
this hour?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what I would want of him at any hour,&#8221;
returned the Western girl, who was beginning to
become heartily exasperated.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that, Miss?&#8221; snapped the housekeeper.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have come to him for hospitality. I
am his relative&mdash;rather, I am Aunt Eunice&#8217;s relative&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean, child?&#8221; exclaimed the
lady, with sudden emotion. &#8220;Who is your Aunt
Eunice?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Starkweather. He married my mother&#8217;s
sister&mdash;my Aunt Eunice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Starkweather!&#8221; gasped Mrs. Olstrom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, where have <i>you</i> been these past three
years?&#8221; demanded the housekeeper in wonder.
&#8220;Mrs. Starkweather has been dead all of that
time. Mr. Willets Starkweather is a widower.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Eunice dead?&#8221; cried Helen.</p>
<p>The news was a distinct shock to the girl. She
forgot everything else for the moment. Her face
told her story all too well, and the housekeeper
could not doubt her longer.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a relative, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her&mdash;her niece, Helen Morrell,&#8221; sobbed
Helen. &#8220;Oh! I did not know&mdash;I did not
know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind. You are entitled to hospitality
and protection. Did you just arrive?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Your home is not near?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In Montana.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My goodness! You cannot go back to-night,
that is sure. But why did you not write?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I telegraphed I was coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never heard of it. Perhaps the message was
not received. Gregson!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; replied the footman.</p>
<p>&#8220;You said something about a taxicab waiting
outside with this young lady&#8217;s luggage?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go and pay the man and have the baggage
brought in&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pay for it, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said Helen, hastily,
trying to unlock her bag.</p>
<p>&#8220;That will be all right. I will settle it with
Mr. Starkweather. Here is money, Gregson.
Pay the fare and give the man a quarter for himself.
Have the trunk brought into the basement.
I will attend to Miss&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Morrell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Morrell, myself,&#8221; finished the housekeeper.</p>
<p>The footman withdrew. The housekeeper
looked hard at Helen for several moments.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you came here expecting hospitality&mdash;in
your uncle&#8217;s house&mdash;and from your cousins?&#8221; she
observed, jerkily. &#8220;Well!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>She got up and motioned Helen to take up her
bag.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come. I have no orders regarding you. I
shall give you one of the spare rooms. You are
entitled to that much. No knowing when either
Mr. Starkweather or the young ladies will be
at home,&#8221; she said, grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you won&#8217;t put yourself out,&#8221; observed
Helen, politely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not likely to,&#8221; returned Mrs. Olstrom.
&#8220;It is you who will be more likely&mdash;&mdash; Well!&#8221;
she finished, without making her meaning very
plain.</p>
<p>This reception, to cap all that had gone before
since she had arrived at the Grand Central Terminal,
chilled Helen. The shock of discovering
that her mother&#8217;s sister was dead&mdash;and she and
her father had not been informed of it&mdash;was no
small one, either. She wished now that she had
not come to the house at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would better have gone to a hotel until I
found out how they felt toward me,&#8221; thought the
girl from the ranch.</p>
<p>Yet Helen was just. She began to tell herself
that neither Mr. Starkweather nor her cousins
were proved guilty of the rudeness of her reception.
The telegram might have gone astray.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
They might never have dreamed of her coming on
from Sunset Ranch to pay them a visit.</p>
<p>The housekeeper began to warm toward her in
manner, at least. She took her up another flight
of stairs and to a very large and handsomely furnished
chamber, although it was at the rear of the
house, and right beside the stairs leading to the
servants&#8217; quarters. At least, so Mrs. Olstrom
said they were.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will not mind, Miss,&#8221; she said, grimly.
&#8220;You may hear the sound of walking in this hall.
It is nothing. The foolish maids call it &#8216;the ghost
walk&#8217;; but it is only a sound. You&#8217;re not superstitious;
are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope not!&#8221; exclaimed Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! I have had to send away one or two
girls. The house is very old. There are some
queer stories about it. Well! What is a sound?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very true, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; agreed Helen, rather confused,
but bound to be polite.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Miss, will you have some supper? Mr.
Lawdor can get you some in the butler&#8217;s pantry.
He has a chafing dish there and often prepares late
bites for his master.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am; I am not hungry,&#8221; Helen declared.
&#8220;I had dinner in the dining car at seven.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I will leave you&mdash;unless you should
wish something further?&#8221; said the housekeeper.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Here is your bath,&#8221; opening a door into the anteroom.
&#8220;I will place a note upon Mr. Starkweather&#8217;s
desk saying that you are here. Will you
need your trunk up to-night, Miss?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, indeed,&#8221; Helen declared. &#8220;I have a
kimono here&mdash;and other things. I&#8217;ll be glad of
the bath, though. One does get so dusty traveling.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was unlocking her bag. For a moment she
hesitated, half tempted to take the housekeeper
into her confidence regarding her money. But the
woman went directly to the door and bowed herself
out with a stiff:</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night, Miss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My! But this is a friendly place!&#8221; mused
Helen, when she was left alone. &#8220;And they seem
to have so much confidence in strangers!&#8221;</p>
<p>Therefore, she went to the door into the hall,
found there was a bolt upon it, and shot it home.
Then she pulled the curtain across the keyhole
before sitting down and counting all her money
over again.</p>
<p>&#8220;They got <i>me</i> doing it!&#8221; muttered Helen.
&#8220;I shall be afraid of every person I meet in this
man&#8217;s town.&#8221;</p>
<p>But by and by she hopped up, hid the wallet
under her pillow (the bed was a big one with deep
mattress and downy pillows) and then ran to let
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
her bath run in the little room where Mrs. Olstrom
had snapped on the electric light.</p>
<p>She undressed slowly, shook out her garments,
hung them properly to air, and stepped into the
grateful bath. How good it felt after her long
and tiresome journey by train!</p>
<p>But as she was drying herself on the fleecy
towels she suddenly heard a sound outside her
door. After the housekeeper left her the whole
building had seemed as silent as a tomb. Now
there was a steady rustling noise in the short corridor
on which her room opened.</p>
<p>&#8220;What <i>did</i> that woman ask me?&#8221; murmured
Helen. &#8220;Was I afraid of ghosts?&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed a little. To a healthy, normal,
outdoor girl the supernatural had few
terrors.</p>
<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> a funny sound,&#8221; she admitted, hastily
finished the drying process and then slipping into
her nightrobe, kimono, and bed slippers.</p>
<p>All the time her ear seemed preternaturally
attuned to that rising and waning sound without
her chamber. It seemed to come toward the door,
pass it, move lightly away, and then turn and repass
again. It was a steady, regular&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Step&mdash;put; step&mdash;put; step&mdash;put&mdash;&mdash;</i></p>
<p>And with it was the rustle of garments&mdash;or so
it seemed. The girl grew momentarily more curious.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
The mystery of the strange sound certainly
was puzzling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who ever heard of a ghost with a wooden
leg?&#8221; she thought, chuckling softly to herself.
&#8220;And that is what it sounds like. No wonder
the servants call this corridor &#8216;the ghost walk.&#8217;
Well, me for bed!&#8221;</p>
<p>She had already snapped out the electric light
in the bathroom, and now hopped into bed, reaching
up to pull the chain of the reading light as
she did so. The top of one window was down
half-way and the noise of the city at midnight
reached her ear in a dull monotone.</p>
<p>Back here at the rear of the great mansion,
street sounds were faint. In the distance, to the
eastward, was the roar of a passing elevated train.
An automobile horn hooted raucously.</p>
<p>But steadily, through all other sounds, as an
accompaniment to them and to Helen Morrell&#8217;s
own thoughts, was the continuous rustle in the
corridor outside her door:</p>
<p><i>Step&mdash;put; step&mdash;put; step&mdash;put.</i></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>MORNING</h3>
</div>

<p>The Starkweather mansion was a large dwelling.
Built some years before the Civil War, it
had been one of the &#8220;great houses&#8221; in its day, to
be pointed out to the mid-nineteenth century visitor
to the metropolis. Of course, when the sightseeing
coaches came in fashion they went up Fifth
Avenue and passed by the stately mansions of the
Victorian era, on Madison Avenue, without comment.</p>
<p>Willets Starkweather had sprung from a quite
mean and un-noted branch of the family, and had
never, until middle life, expected to live in the
Madison Avenue homestead. The important
members of his clan were dead and gone and their
great fortunes scattered. Willets Starkweather
could barely keep up with the expenditures of his
great household.</p>
<p>There were never servants enough, and Mrs.
Olstrom, the very capable housekeeper, who had
served the present master&#8217;s great-uncle before the
day of the new generation, had hard work to satisfy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
the demands of those there were upon the
means allowed her by Mr. Starkweather.</p>
<p>There were rooms in the house&mdash;especially upon
the topmost floor&mdash;into which even the servants
seldom went. There were vacant rooms which
never knew broom nor duster. The dwelling, indeed,
was altogether too large for the needs of Mr.
Starkweather and his three motherless daughters.</p>
<p>But their living in it gave them a prestige which
nothing else could. As wise as any match-making
matron, Willets Starkweather knew that the
family&#8217;s address at this particular number on
Madison Avenue would aid his daughters more
in &#8220;making a good match&#8221; than anything else.</p>
<p>He could not dower them. Really, they needed
no dower with their good looks, for they were all
pretty. The Madison Avenue mansion gave them
the open sesame into good society&mdash;choice society,
in fact&mdash;and there some wealthy trio of unattached
young men must see and fall in love with
them.</p>
<p>And the girls understood this, too&mdash;right down
to fourteen-year-old Flossie. They all three knew
that to &#8220;pay poor papa&#8221; for reckless expenditures
now, they must sooner or later capture
moneyed husbands.</p>
<p>So, there was more than one reason why the
three Starkweather girls leaped immediately from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
childhood into full-blown womanhood. Flossie
had already privately studied the characters&mdash;and
possible bank accounts&mdash;of the boys of her acquaintance,
to decide upon whom she should smile
her sweetest.</p>
<p>These facts&mdash;save that the mansion was enormous&mdash;were
hidden from Helen when she arose
on the first morning of her city experience. She
had slept soundly and sweetly. Even the rustling
steps on the ghost walk had not bothered her for
long.</p>
<p>Used to being up and out by sunrise, she could
not easily fall in with city ways. She hustled out
of bed soon after daybreak, took a cold sponge,
which made her body tingle delightfully, and got
into her clothes as rapidly as any boy.</p>
<p>She had only the shoddy-looking brown traveling
dress to wear, and the out-of-date hat. But
she put them on, and ventured downstairs, intent
upon going out for a walk before breakfast.</p>
<p>The solemn clock in the hall chimed seven as
she found her way down the lower flight of front
stairs. As she came through the curtain-hung halls
and down the stairs, not a soul did she meet until
she reached the front hall. There a rather decrepit-looking
man, with a bleared eye, and dressed
in decent black, hobbled out of a parlor to meet
her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Bless me!&#8221; he ejaculated. &#8220;What&mdash;what&mdash;what&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Helen Morrell,&#8221; said the girl from Sunset
Ranch, smiling, and judging that this must
be the butler of whom the housekeeper had spoken
the night before. &#8220;I have just come to visit my
uncle and cousins.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless me!&#8221; said the old man again. &#8220;Gregson
told me. Proud to see you, Miss. But&mdash;you&#8217;re
dressed to go out, Miss?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For a walk, sir,&#8221; replied Helen, nodding.</p>
<p>&#8220;At this hour? Bless me&mdash;bless me&mdash;bless
me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He seemed apt to run off in this style, in an
unending string of mild expletives. His head
shook and his hands seemed palsied. But he was
a polite old man.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg of you, Miss, don&#8217;t go out without a
bit of breakfast. My own coffee is dripping in
the percolator. Let me give you a cup,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;if it&#8217;s not too much trouble, sir&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This way, Miss,&#8221; he said, hurrying on before,
and leading Helen to a cozy little room at
the back. This corresponded with the housekeeper&#8217;s
sitting-room and Helen believed it must
be Mr. Lawdor&#8217;s own apartment.</p>
<p>He laid a small cloth with a flourish. He set
forth a silver breakfast set. He did everything
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
neatly and with an alacrity that surprised Helen
in one so evidently decrepit.</p>
<p>&#8220;A chop, now, Miss? Or a rasher?&#8221; he asked,
pointing to an array of electric appliances on the
sideboard by which a breakfast might be &#8220;tossed
up&#8221; in a hurry.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; Helen declared. &#8220;Not so early.
This nice coffee and these delicious rolls are enough
until I have earned more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Earned more, Miss?&#8221; he asked, in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;By exercise,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;I am going to
take a good tramp. Then I shall come back as
hungry as a mountain lion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The family breakfasts at nine, Miss,&#8221; said the
butler, bowing. &#8220;But if you are an early riser
you will always find something tidy here in my
room, Miss. You are very welcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>She thanked him and went out into the hall
again. The footman in livery&mdash;very sleepy and
tousled as yet&mdash;was unchaining the front door. A
yawning maid was at work in one of the parlors
with a duster. She stared at Helen in amazement,
but Gregson stood stiffly at attention as the visitor
went forth into the daylight.</p>
<p>&#8220;My, how funny city people live!&#8221; thought
Helen Morrell. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I ever could
stand it. Up till all hours, and then no breakfast
until nine. <i>What</i> a way to live!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And there must be twice as many servants as
there are members of the family&mdash;&mdash; Why! more
than that! And all that big house to get lost in,&#8221;
she added, glancing up at it as she started off
upon her walk.</p>
<p>She turned the first corner and went through a
side street toward the west. This was not a business
side street. There were several tall apartment
hotels interspersed with old houses.</p>
<p>She came to Fifth Avenue&mdash;&#8220;the most beautiful
street in the world.&#8221; It had been swept and
garnished by a horde of white-robed men since
two o&#8217;clock. On this brisk October morning, from
the Washington Arch to 110th Street, it was as
clean as a whistle.</p>
<p>She walked uptown. At Thirty-fourth and
Forty-second streets the crosstown traffic had already
begun. She passed the new department
stores, already opening their eyes and yawning in
advance of the day&#8217;s trade.</p>
<p>There were a few pedestrians headed uptown
like herself. Some well-dressed men seemed walking
to business. A few neat shop girls were hurrying
along the pavement, too. But Helen, and the
dogs in leash, had the avenue mostly to themselves
at this hour.</p>
<p>The sleepy maids, or footmen, or pages stared
at the Western girl with curiosity as she strode
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
along. For, unlike many from the plains, Helen
could walk well in addition to riding well.</p>
<p>She reached the plaza, and crossing it, entered
the park. The trees were just coloring prettily.
There were morning sounds from the not-far-distant
zoo. A few early nursemaids and their
charges asleep in baby carriages, were abroad.
Several old gentlemen read their morning papers
upon the benches, or fed the squirrels who were
skirmishing for their breakfasts.</p>
<p>Several plainly-dressed people were evidently
taking their own &#8220;constitutionals&#8221; through the
park paths. Swinging down from the north come
square-shouldered, cleanly-shaven young men of
the same type as Dud Stone. Helen believed that
Dud must be a typical New Yorker.</p>
<p>But there were no girls abroad&mdash;at least, girls
like herself who had leisure. And Helen was
timid about making friends with the nursemaids.</p>
<p>In fact, there wasn&#8217;t a soul who smiled upon
her as she walked through the paths. She would
not have dared approach any person she met for
any purpose whatsoever.</p>
<p>&#8220;They haven&#8217;t a grain of interest in me,&#8221;
thought Helen. &#8220;Many of them, I suppose,
don&#8217;t even see me. Goodness, what a lot of self-centred
people there must be in New York!&#8221;</p>
<p>She wandered on and on. She had no watch&mdash;never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
had owned one. As she had told Dud
Stone, the stars at night were her clock, and by
day she judged the hour by the sun.</p>
<p>The sun was behind a haze now; but she had
another sure timekeeper. There was nothing the
matter with Helen&#8217;s appetite.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go back and join the family at breakfast,&#8221;
the girl thought. &#8220;I hope they&#8217;ll be nice to me.
And poor Aunt Eunice dead without our ever being
told of it! Strange!&#8221;</p>
<p>She had come a good way. Indeed, she was
some time in finding an outlet from the park. The
sun was behind the morning haze as yet, but she
turned east, and finally came out upon the avenue
some distance above the gateway by which she had
entered.</p>
<p>A southbound auto-bus caught her eye and she
signaled it. She not only had brought her purse
with her, but the wallet with her money was stuffed
inside her blouse and made an uncomfortable
lump there at her waist. But she hid this with
her arm, feeling that she must be on the watch for
some sharper all the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Big Hen was right when he warned me,&#8221; she
repeated, eyeing suspiciously the several passengers
in the Fifth Avenue bus.</p>
<p>They were mostly early shoppers, however, or
gentlemen riding to their offices. She had noticed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
the number of the street nearest her uncle&#8217;s house,
and so got out at the right corner.</p>
<p>The change in this part of the town since she
had walked away from it soon after seven, amazed
her. She almost became confused and started in
the wrong direction. The roar of traffic, the rattle
of riveters at work on several new buildings in
the neighborhood, the hoarse honking of automobiles,
the shrill whistles of the traffic policemen
at the corners, and the various other sounds
seemed to make another place of the old-fashioned
Madison Avenue block.</p>
<p>&#8220;My goodness! To live in such confusion,
and yet have money enough to be able to enjoy
a home out of town,&#8221; thought Helen. &#8220;How
foolish of Uncle Starkweather.&#8221;</p>
<p>She made no mistake in the house this time.
There was Gregson&mdash;now spick and span in his
maroon livery&mdash;haughtily mounting guard over
the open doorway while a belated scrubwoman was
cleaning the steps and areaway.</p>
<p>Helen tripped up the steps with a smile for
Gregson; but that wooden-faced subject of King
George had no joint in his neck. He could merely
raise a finger in salute.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the family up, sir?&#8221; she asked, politely.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Mr. Starkweather&#8217;s den, Miss,&#8221; said the
footman, being unable to leave his post at the moment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
Mr. Lawdor was not in sight and Helen
set out to find the room in question, wondering
if the family had already breakfasted. The clock
in the hall chimed the quarter to ten as she
passed it.</p>
<p>The great rooms on this floor were open now;
but empty. She suddenly heard voices. She found
a cross passage that she had not noticed before,
and entered it, the voices growing louder.</p>
<p>She came to a door before which hung heavy
curtains; but these curtains did not deaden the
sound entirely. Indeed, as Helen hesitated, with
her hand stretched out to seize the portière, she
heard something that halted her.</p>
<p>Indeed, what she heard within the next few
moments entirely changed the outlook of the girl
from Sunset Ranch. It matured that doubt of
humanity that had been born the night before in
her breast.</p>
<p>And it changed&mdash;for the time being at least&mdash;Helen&#8217;s
nature. From a frank, open-hearted, loving
girl she became suspicious, morose and secretive.
The first words she heard held her spell-bound&mdash;an
unintentional eavesdropper. And what
she heard made her determined to appear to her
unkind relatives quite as they expected her to
appear.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>LIVING UP TO ONE&#8217;S REPUTATION</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Well! my lady certainly takes her time about
getting up,&#8221; Belle Starkweather was saying.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was tired after her journey, I presume,&#8221;
her father said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Across the continent in a day-coach, I suppose,&#8221;
laughed Hortense, yawning.</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>was</i> astonished at that bill for taxi hire
Olstrom put on your desk, Pa,&#8221; said Belle. &#8220;She
must have ridden all over town before she came
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A girl who couldn&#8217;t take a plain hint,&#8221; cried
Hortense, &#8220;and stay away altogether when we
didn&#8217;t answer her telegram&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, girls. We must treat her kindly,&#8221; said
their father. &#8220;Ahem!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see <i>why</i>?&#8221; demanded Hortense,
bluntly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand everything,&#8221; responded
Mr. Starkweather, rather weakly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand <i>you</i>, Pa, sometimes,&#8221; declared
Hortense.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell you one thing right now!&#8221;
snapped the older girl. &#8220;I&#8217;ve ordered her things
taken out of that chamber. Her shabby old trunk
has gone up to the room at the top of the servants&#8217;
stairway. It&#8217;s good enough for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We certainly have not got to have this cowgirl
around for long,&#8221; continued Hortense.
&#8220;She&#8217;d be no fit company for Flossie. Flossie&#8217;s
rude enough as it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>The youngest daughter had gone to school, so
she was not present with her saucy tongue to hold
up her own end of the argument.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of a girl right from a cattle ranch!&#8221;
laughed Belle. &#8220;Fine! I suppose she knows how
to rope steers, and break ponies, and ride bareback
like an Indian, and all that. Fine accomplishments
for a New York drawing-room, I must say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; joined in Hortense. &#8220;And she&#8217;ll
say &#8216;I reckon,&#8217; and drop her &#8216;g&#8217;s&#8217; and otherwise
insult the King&#8217;s English.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahem! I must warn you girls to be less
boisterous,&#8221; advised their father.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you sound as though you were almost
afraid of this cowgirl, Pa,&#8221; said Belle, curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; protested Mr. Starkweather, hurriedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pa&#8217;s so easy,&#8221; complained Hortense. &#8220;If I
had my way I wouldn&#8217;t let her stay the day out.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But where would she go?&#8221; almost whined
Mr. Starkweather.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back where she came from.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps the folks there don&#8217;t want her,&#8221; said
Belle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course she&#8217;s a pauper,&#8221; observed Hortense.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give her some money and send her away, Pa,&#8221;
begged Belle.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to. She&#8217;s not fit to associate with
Flossie. You know just how Floss picks up every
little thing&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And she&#8217;s that man&#8217;s daughter, too, you
know,&#8221; remarked Belle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahem!&#8221; said their father, weakly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not decent to have her here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, other people will remember what
Morrell did. It will make a scandal for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot help it! I cannot help it!&#8221; cried
Mr. Starkweather, suddenly breaking out and
battling against his daughters as he sometimes did
when they pressed him too closely. &#8220;I cannot
send her away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she mustn&#8217;t be encouraged to stay,&#8221; declared
Hortense.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say not,&#8221; rejoined Belle.</p>
<p>&#8220;And getting up at this hour to breakfast,&#8221;
Hortense sniffed.</p>
<p>Helen Morrell wore strong, well-made walking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
boots. Good shoes were something that she could
always buy in Elberon. But usually she walked
lightly and springily.</p>
<p>Now she came stamping through the small hall,
and on the heels of the last remark, flung back
the curtain and strode into the den.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo, folks!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Goodness! don&#8217;t
you get up till noon here in town? I&#8217;ve been clean
out to your city park while I waited for you to
wash your faces. Uncle Starkweather! how be
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>She had grabbed the hand of the amazed gentleman
and was now pumping it with a vigor that
left him breathless.</p>
<p>&#8220;And these air two of your gals?&#8221; quoth
Helen. &#8220;I bet I can pick &#8217;em out by name,&#8221; and
she laughed loudly. &#8220;This is Belle; ain&#8217;t it? Put
it thar!&#8221; and she took the resisting Belle&#8217;s hand
and squeezed it in her own brown one until
the older girl winced, muscular as she herself
was.</p>
<p>&#8220;And this is &#8217;Tense&mdash;I know!&#8221; added the girl
from Sunset Ranch, reaching for the hand of her
other cousin.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t!&#8221; cried Hortense, putting her
hands behind her. &#8220;Why! you&#8217;d crush my
hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ho, ho!&#8221; laughed Helen, slapping her hand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
heartily upon her knee as she sat down. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t
you the puny one!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m no great, rude&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahem!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Starkweather, recovering
from his amazement in time to shut off the
snappy remark of Hortense. &#8220;We&mdash;we are glad
to see you, girl&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew you&#8217;d be!&#8221; cried Helen, loudly. &#8220;I
told &#8217;em back on the ranch that you an&#8217; the gals
would jest about eat me up, you&#8217;d be so glad,
when ye seen me. Relatives oughter be neighborly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neighborly!&#8221; murmured Hortense. &#8220;And
from Montana!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Butcher got another one; ain&#8217;t ye, Uncle
Starkweather?&#8221; demanded the metamorphosed
Helen, looking about with a broad smile.
&#8220;Where&#8217;s the little tad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Little tad&#8217;! Oh, won&#8217;t Flossie be pleased?&#8221;
again murmured Hortense.</p>
<p>&#8220;My youngest daughter is at school,&#8221; replied
Mr. Starkweather, nervously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks! of course,&#8221; said Helen, nodding. &#8220;I
forgot they go to school half their lives down
east here. Out my way we don&#8217;t get much chance
at schoolin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I perceive,&#8221; remarked Hortense, aloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I expect <i>you</i>,&#8217;Tense,&#8221; said Helen, wickedly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
&#8220;have been through all the isms and the
ologies there be&mdash;eh? You look like you&#8217;d been
all worn to a frazzle studyin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Belle giggled. Hortense bridled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really wish you wouldn&#8217;t call me out of my
name,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Hortense,&#8221; said that young lady,
coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks! So it is. But that&#8217;s moughty long
for a single mouthful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Belle giggled again. Hortense looked disgusted.
Uncle Starkweather was somewhat shocked.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&mdash;ahem!&mdash;hope you will enjoy yourself
here while you&mdash;er&mdash;remain,&#8221; he began. &#8220;Of
course, your visit will be more or less brief, I
suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jest accordin&#8217; to how ye like me and how I
like you folks,&#8221; returned the girl from Sunset
Ranch, heartily. &#8220;When Big Hen seen me
off&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&mdash;<i>who</i>?&#8221; demanded Hortense, faintly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Big Hen Billings,&#8221; said Helen, in an explanatory
manner. &#8220;Hen was dad&#8217;s&mdash;that is he worked
with dad on the ranch. When I come away I
told Big Hen not to look for me back till I arrove.
Didn&#8217;t know how I&#8217;d find you-all, or how I&#8217;d
like the city. City&#8217;s all right; only nobody gets
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
up early. And I expect we-all can&#8217;t tell how we
like each other until we get better acquainted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very true&mdash;very true,&#8221; remarked Mr. Starkweather,
faintly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, goodness! I&#8217;m hungry!&#8221; exclaimed
Helen. &#8220;You folks ain&#8217;t fed yet; have ye?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have breakfasted,&#8221; said Belle, scornfully.
&#8220;I will ring for the butler. You may tell Lawdor
what you want&mdash;er&mdash;<i>Cousin</i> Helen,&#8221; and she
looked at Hortense.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; cried Helen. &#8220;Sorry to keep you waiting.
Ye see, I didn&#8217;t have any watch and the sun
was clouded over this morning. Sort of run over
my time limit&mdash;eh? Ah!&mdash;is this Mr. Lawdor?&#8221;</p>
<p>The shaky old butler stood in the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is <i>Lawdor</i>,&#8221; said Belle, emphatically. &#8220;Is
there any breakfast left, Lawdor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss Belle. When Gregson told me the
young miss was not at the table I kept something
hot and hot for her, Miss. Shall I serve it in my
room?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may as well,&#8221; said Belle, carelessly.
&#8220;And, <i>Cousin</i> Helen!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep?&#8221; chirped the girl from the ranch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, while you are here, we could not
have you in the room you occupied last night. It&mdash;it
might be needed. I have already told Olstrom,
the housekeeper, to take your bag and other things
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
up to the next floor. Ask one of the maids to
show you the room you are to occupy&mdash;<i>while you
remain</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, Belle,&#8221; returned the Western
girl, with great heartiness. &#8220;Any old place will
do for me. Why! I&#8217;ve slept on the ground more
nights than you could shake a stick at,&#8221; and she
tramped off after the tottering butler.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; gasped Hortense when she was
out of hearing, &#8220;what do you know about <i>that</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pa, do you intend to let that dowdy little
thing stay here?&#8221; cried Belle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahem!&#8221; murmured Mr. Starkweather, running
a finger around between his collar and his
neck, as though to relieve the pressure there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her clothes came out of the ark!&#8221; declared
Hortense.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that hat!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And those boots&mdash;or is it because she clumps
them so? I expect she is more used to riding than
to walking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And her language!&#8221; rejoined Belle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahem! What&mdash;what can we do, girls?&#8221;
gasped Mr. Starkweather.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put her out!&#8221; cried Belle, loudly and angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is quite too, too impossible, Pa,&#8221; agreed
Hortense.</p>
<p>&#8220;With her coarse jokes,&#8221; said the older sister.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And her rough way,&#8221; echoed the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that ugly dress and hat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A pauper relation! Faugh! I didn&#8217;t know
the Starkweathers owned one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems to me, <i>one</i> queer person in the house is
enough,&#8221; began Hortense.</p>
<p>Her father and sister looked at her sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Hortense!&#8221; exclaimed Belle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahem!&#8221; observed Mr. Starkweather, warningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! we don&#8217;t want <i>that</i> freak in the house,&#8221;
grumbled the younger sister.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are&mdash;ahem!&mdash;some things best left unsaid,&#8221;
observed her father, pompously. &#8220;But
about this girl from the West&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Pa!&#8221; cried his daughters in duet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will see what can be done. Of course, she
cannot expect me to support her for long. I will
have a serious talk with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When, Pa?&#8221; cried the two girls again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Er&mdash;ahem!&mdash;soon,&#8221; declared the gentleman,
and beat a hasty retreat.</p>
<p>&#8220;It had better be pretty soon,&#8221; said Belle, bitterly,
to her sister. &#8220;For I won&#8217;t stand that
dowdy thing here for long, now I tell you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good for you, Belle!&#8221; rejoined Hortense,
warmly. &#8220;It&#8217;s strange if we can&#8217;t&mdash;with Flossie&#8217;s
help&mdash;soon make her sick of her visit.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>&#8220;I MUST LEARN THE TRUTH&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>Helen was already very sick of her Uncle
Starkweather&#8217;s home and family. But she was
too proud to show the depth of her feeling before
the old serving man in whose charge she had been
momentarily placed.</p>
<p>Lawdor was plainly pleased to wait upon her.
He made fresh coffee in his own percolator; there
was a cutlet kept warm upon an electric stove, and
he insisted upon frying her a rasher of bacon and
some eggs.</p>
<p>Despite all that mentally troubled her, her
healthy body needed nourishment and Helen ate
with an appetite that pleased the old man immensely.</p>
<p>&#8220;If&mdash;if you go out early, Miss, don&#8217;t forget
to come here for your coffee,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Or more,
if you please. I shall be happy to serve you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m happy to have you,&#8221; returned the
girl, heartily.</p>
<p>She could not assume to him the rude tone and
manner which she had displayed to her uncle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
and cousins. <i>That</i> had been the outcome of an
impulse which had risen from the unkind expressions
she had heard them use about her.</p>
<p>As soon as she could get away, she had ceased
being an eavesdropper. But she had heard enough
to assure her that her relatives were not glad to
see her; that they were rude and unkind, and that
they were disturbed by her presence among them.</p>
<p>But there was another thing she had drawn
from their ill-advised talk, too. She had heard
her father mentioned in no kind way. Hints were
thrown out that Prince Morrell&#8217;s crime&mdash;or the
crime of which he had been accused&mdash;was still remembered
in New York.</p>
<p>Back into her soul had come that wave of feeling
she experienced after her father&#8217;s death. He
had been so troubled by the smirch upon his name&mdash;the
cloud that had blighted his young manhood
in the great city.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll know the truth,&#8221; she thought again. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
find out who <i>was</i> guilty. They sha&#8217;n&#8217;t drive me
away until I have accomplished my object in coming
East.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was the only thought she had while she
remained under old Lawdor&#8217;s eye. She had to
bear up, and seem unruffled until the breakfast was
disposed of and she could escape upstairs.</p>
<p>She went up the servants&#8217; way. She saw the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
same girl she had noticed in the parlor early in
the morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you show me my room?&#8221; she asked her,
timidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Top o&#8217; the next flight. Door&#8217;s open,&#8221; replied
the girl, shortly.</p>
<p>Already the news had gone abroad among the
under servants that this was a poor relation. No
tips need be expected. The girl flirted her cloth
and turned her back upon Helen as the latter
started through the ghost walk and up the other
stairway.</p>
<p>She easily found the room. It was quite as good
as her own room at the ranch, as far as size and
furniture went. Helen would have been amply
satisfied with it had the room been given to her in
a different spirit.</p>
<p>But now she closed her door, locked it carefully,
hung her jacket over the knob that she should be
sure she was not spied upon, and sat down beside
the bed.</p>
<p>She was not a girl who cried often. She had
wept sincere tears the evening before when she
learned that Aunt Eunice was dead. But she could
not weep now.</p>
<p>Her emotion was emphatically wrathful. Without
cause&mdash;that she could see&mdash;these city relatives
had maligned her&mdash;had maligned her father&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
memory&mdash;and had cruelly shown her, a stranger,
how they thoroughly hated her presence.</p>
<p>She had come away from Sunset Ranch with
two well-devised ideas in her mind. First of all,
she hoped to clear her father&#8217;s name of that old
smirch upon it. Secondly, he had wished her to
live with her relatives if possible, that she might
become used to the refinements and circumstances
of a more civilized life.</p>
<p>Refinements! Why, these cousins of hers hadn&#8217;t
the decencies of red Indians!</p>
<p>On impulse Helen had taken the tone she had
with them&mdash;had showed them in &#8220;that cowgirl&#8221;
just what they had expected to find. She would be
bluff and rude and ungrammatical and ill-bred.
Perhaps the spirit in which Helen did this was not
to be commended; but she had begun it on the impulse
of the moment and she felt she must keep it
up during her stay in the Starkweather house.</p>
<p>How long that would be Helen was not prepared
to say now. It was in her heart one moment
not to unpack her trunk at all. She could go to
a hotel&mdash;the best in New York, if she so desired.
How amazed her cousins would be if they knew
that she was at this moment carrying more than
eight hundred dollars in cash on her person? And
suppose they learned that she owned thousands
upon thousands of acres of grazing land in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
own right, on which roamed unnumbered cattle
and horses?</p>
<p>Suppose they found out that she had been
schooled in a first-class institution in Denver&mdash;probably
as well schooled as they themselves?
What would they say? How would they feel
should they suddenly make these discoveries?</p>
<p>But, while she sat there and studied the problem
out, Helen came to at least one determination:
While she remained in the Starkweather house she
would keep from her uncle and cousins the knowledge
of these facts.</p>
<p>She would not reveal her real character to them.
She would continue to parade before them and
before their friends the very rudeness and ignorance
that they had expected her to betray.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are ashamed of me&mdash;let them be
ashamed,&#8221; she said, to herself, bitterly. &#8220;They
hate me&mdash;I&#8217;ll give them no reason for loving me,
I promise you! They think me a pauper&mdash;I&#8217;ll <i>be</i>
a pauper. Until I get ready to leave here, at
least. Then I can settle with Uncle Starkweather
in one lump for all the expense to which he may be
put for me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll buy no nice dresses&mdash;or hats&mdash;or anything
else. They sha&#8217;n&#8217;t know I have a penny to spend.
If they want to treat me like a poor relation, let
them. I&#8217;ll <i>be</i> a poor relation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I must learn the truth about poor dad&#8217;s trouble,&#8221;
she told herself again. &#8220;Uncle Starkweather
must know something about it. I want to
question him. He may be able to help me. I may
get on the track of that bookkeeper. And he can
tell me, surely, where to find Fenwick Grimes, father&#8217;s
old partner.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. They shall serve me without knowing it.
I will be beholden to them for my bread and butter
and shelter&mdash;for a time. Let them hate and
despise me. What I have to do I will do. Then
I&#8217;ll &#8216;pay the shot,&#8217; as Big Hen would say, and
walk out and leave them.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a bold determination, but not one that is
to be praised. Yet, Helen had provocation for
the course she proposed to pursue.</p>
<p>She finally unlocked her trunk and hung up the
common dresses and other garments she had
brought with her. She had intended to ask her
cousins to take her shopping right away, and she,
like any other girl of her age, longed for new
frocks and pretty hats.</p>
<p>But there was a lot of force in Helen&#8217;s character.
She would go without anything pretty unless
her cousins offered to buy it themselves. She
would bide her time.</p>
<p>One thing she hid far back in her closet under
the other things&mdash;her riding habit. She knew it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
would give the lie to her supposed poverty. She
had sent to Chicago for that, and it had cost a
hundred dollars.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t suppose there&#8217;d be a chance to
ride in this big town,&#8221; she thought, with a sigh.
&#8220;Unless it is hobby-horses in the park. Well! I
can get on for a time without the Rose pony, or
any other critter on four legs, to love me.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she was hungry for the companionship of
the animals whom she had seen daily on the
ranch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, even the yip of a coyote would be
sweet,&#8221; she mused, putting her head out of the
window and scanning nothing but chimneys and
tin roofs, with bare little yards far below.</p>
<p>Finally she heard a Japanese gong&#8217;s mellow
note, and presumed it must announce luncheon.
It was already two o&#8217;clock. People who breakfasted
at nine or ten, of course did not need a midday
meal.</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect they don&#8217;t have supper till bedtime,&#8221;
thought Helen.</p>
<p>First she hid her wallet in the bottom of her
trunk, locked the trunk and set it up on end in the
closet. Then she locked the closet door and took
out the key, hiding the latter under the edge of the
carpet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting as bad as the rest of &#8217;em,&#8221; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
muttered. &#8220;I won&#8217;t trust anybody, either. Now
for meeting my dear cousins at lunch.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had slipped into one of the simple house
dresses she had worn at the ranch. She had noticed
that forenoon that both Belle and Hortense
Starkweather were dressed in the most modish
of gowns&mdash;as elaborate as those of fashionable
ladies. With no mother to say them nay,
these young girls aped every new fashion as they
pleased.</p>
<p>Helen started downstairs at first with her usual
light step. Then she bethought herself, stumbled
on a stair, slipped part of the way, and continued
to the very bottom of the last flight with a noise
and clatter which must have announced her coming
long in advance of her actual presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to play eavesdropper again,&#8221; she
told herself, grimly. &#8220;I always understood that
listeners hear no good of themselves, and now I
know it to be a fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gregson stood at the bottom of the last flight.
His face was as wooden as ever, but he managed
to open his lips far enough to observe:</p>
<p>&#8220;Luncheon is served in the breakfast room,
Miss.&#8221;</p>
<p>A sweep of his arm pointed the way. Then she
saw old Lawdor pottering in and out of a room
into which she had not yet looked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>It proved to be a sunny, small dining-room.
When alone the family usually ate here, Helen
discovered. The real dining-room was big enough
for a dancing floor, with an enormous table, preposterously
heavy furniture all around the four
sides of the room, and an air of gloom that would
have removed, before the food appeared, even, all
trace of a healthy appetite.</p>
<p>When Helen entered the brighter apartment her
three cousins were already before her. The noise
she made coming along the hall, despite the heavy
carpets, had quite prepared them for her appearance.</p>
<p>Belle and Hortense met her with covert smiles.
And they watched their younger sister to see what
impression the girl from Sunset Ranch made upon
Flossie.</p>
<p>&#8220;And this is Flossie; is it?&#8221; cried Helen, going
boisterously into the room and heading full tilt
around the table for the amazed Flossie. &#8220;Why,
you look like a smart young&#8217;un! And you&#8217;re only
fourteen? Well, I never!&#8221;</p>
<p>She seized Flossie by both hands, in spite of that
young lady&#8217;s desire to keep them free.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness me! Keep your paws off&mdash;do!&#8221;
ejaculated Flossie, in great disgust. &#8220;And let
me tell you, if I <i>am</i> only fourteen I&#8217;m &#8217;most
as big as you are and I know a whole lot more.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Floss!&#8221; exclaimed Hortense, but unable
to hide her amusement.</p>
<p>The girl from Sunset Ranch took it all with
apparent good nature, however.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you <i>do</i> know a lot. You&#8217;ve had
advantages, you see. Girls out my way don&#8217;t
have much chance, and that&#8217;s a fact. But if I stay
here, don&#8217;t you reckon I&#8217;ll learn?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Starkweather girls exchanged glances of
amusement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not think,&#8221; said Belle, calmly, &#8220;that you
would better think of remaining with us for long.
It would be rather bad for you, I am sure, and
inconvenient for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221; demanded Helen, looking at
her blankly. &#8220;Inconvenient&mdash;and with all this
big house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahem!&#8221; began Belle, copying her father.
&#8220;The house is not always as free of visitors as it
is now. And of course, a girl who has no means
and must earn her living, should not live in
luxury.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked Helen, quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;er&mdash;well, it would not be nice to have a
working girl go in and out of our house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you think I shall have to go to work?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course, you may remain here&mdash;father
says&mdash;until you can place yourself. But he does
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
not believe in fostering idleness. He often says
so,&#8221; said Belle, heaping it all on &#8220;poor Pa.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen had taken her seat at the table and Gregson
was serving. It mattered nothing to these ill-bred
Starkweather girls that the serving people
heard how they treated this &#8220;poor relation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen remained silent for several minutes. She
tried to look sad. Within, however, she was furiously
angry. But this was not the hour for her
to triumph.</p>
<p>Flossie had been giggling for a few moments.
Now she asked her cousin, saucily:</p>
<p>&#8220;I say! Where did you pick up that calico
dress, Helen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This?&#8221; returned the visitor, looking down at
the rather ugly print. &#8220;It&#8217;s a gingham. Bought
it ready-made in Elberon. Do you like it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I love it!&#8221; giggled Flossie. &#8220;And it&#8217;s made
in quite a new style, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think so? Why, I reckoned it was
old,&#8221; said Helen, smoothly. &#8220;But I&#8217;m glad to
hear it&#8217;s so fitten to wear. For, you see, I ain&#8217;t got
many clo&#8217;es.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you have dressmakers out there in Montana?&#8221;
asked Hortense, eyeing the print garment
as though it was something entirely foreign.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon. But we folks on the range don&#8217;t
get much chance at &#8217;em. Dressmakers is as scurce
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
around Sunset Ranch as killyloo birds. Unless
ye mought call Injun squaws dressmakers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are killyloo birds?&#8221; demanded Flossie,
hearing something new.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well now! don&#8217;t you have them here?&#8221; asked
Helen, smiling broadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never heard of them. And I&#8217;ve been to
Bronx Park and seen all the birds in the flying
cage,&#8221; said Flossie. &#8220;Our Nature teacher takes
us out there frequently. It&#8217;s a dreadful bore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t know but you might have &#8217;em
East here,&#8221; observed Helen, pushing along the
time-worn cowboy joke. &#8220;I said they was scurce
around the ranch; and they be. I never saw one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really!&#8221; ejaculated Hortense. &#8220;What are
killyloo birds good for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, near as I ever heard,&#8221; replied Helen,
chuckling, &#8220;they are mostly used for making folks
ask questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I declare!&#8221; snapped Belle. &#8220;She is laughing
at you, girls. You&#8217;re very dense, I&#8217;m sure, Hortense.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say! that&#8217;s a good one!&#8221; laughed Flossie.
But Hortense muttered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Vulgar little thing!&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen smiled tranquilly upon them. Nothing
they said to her could shake her calm. And once
in a while&mdash;as in the case above&mdash;she &#8220;got back&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
at them. She kept consistently to her rude way
of speaking; but she used the tableware with
little awkwardness, and Belle said to Hortense:</p>
<p>&#8220;At least somebody&#8217;s tried to teach her a few
things. She is no sword-swallower.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose Aunt Mary had some refinement,&#8221;
returned Hortense, languidly.</p>
<p>Helen&#8217;s ears were preternaturally sharp. She
heard everything. But she had such good command
of her features that she showed no emotion
at these side remarks.</p>
<p>After luncheon the three sisters separated for
their usual afternoon amusements. Neither of
them gave a thought to Helen&#8217;s loneliness. They
did not ask her what she was going to do, or suggest
anything to her save that, an hour later, when
Belle saw her cousin preparing to leave the house
in the same dress she had worn at luncheon, she
cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Helen, <i>do</i> go out and come in by the lower
door; will you? The basement door, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; replied Helen, cheerfully. &#8220;Saves the
servants work, I suppose, answering the bell.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she knew as well as Belle why the request
was made. Belle was ashamed to have her appear
to be one of the family. If she went in and out by
the servants&#8217; door it would not look so bad.</p>
<p>Helen walked over to the avenue and looked at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
the frocks in the store windows. By their richness
she saw that in this neighborhood, at least, to refit
in a style which would please her cousins would
cost quite a sum of money.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t do it!&#8221; she told herself, stubbornly.
&#8220;If they want me to look well enough to go in and
out of the front door, let them suggest buying
something for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She went back to the Starkweather mansion in
good season; but she entered, as she had been told,
by the area door. One of the maids let her in
and tossed her head when she saw what an out-of-date
appearance this poor relation of her master
made.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; this girl said to the cook, &#8220;if I didn&#8217;t
dress better nor <i>her</i> when I went out, I&#8217;d wait till
afther dark, so I would!&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen heard this, too. But she was a girl who
could stick to her purpose. Criticism should not
move her, she determined; she would continue to
play her part.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Starkweather is in the den, Miss,&#8221; said
the housekeeper, meeting Helen on the stairs.
&#8220;He has asked for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Olstrom was a very grim person, indeed.
If she had shown the girl from the ranch some
little kindliness the night before, she now hid it
all very successfully.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>Helen returned to the lower floor and sought
that room in which she had had her first interview
with her relatives. Mr. Starkweather was
alone. He looked more than a little disturbed;
and of the two he was the more confused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahem! I feel that we must have a serious
talk together, Helen,&#8221; he said, in his pompous
manner. &#8220;It&mdash;it will be quite necessary&mdash;ahem!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; returned the girl. &#8220;Glad to. I&#8217;ve
got some serious things to ask you, too, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh? Eh?&#8221; exclaimed the gentleman, worried
at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;You fire ahead, sir,&#8221; said Helen, sitting down
and crossing one knee over the other in a boyish
fashion. &#8220;My questions will wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;ahem!&mdash;I wish to know who suggested
your coming here to New York?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My father,&#8221; replied Helen, simply and truthfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father?&#8221; The reply evidently both surprised
and discomposed Mr. Starkweather. &#8220;I
do not understand. Your&mdash;your father is
dead&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. It was just before he died.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And he told you to come here to&mdash;to <i>us</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221; demanded the gentleman with
some warmth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Dad said as how you folks lived nice, and
knew all about refinement and eddication and all
that. He wanted me to have a better chance than
what I could get on the ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Starkweather glared at her in amazement.
He was not at all a kind-hearted man; but he was
very cowardly. He had feared her answer would
be quite different from this, and now took courage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say that merely this expressed
wish that you might live at&mdash;ahem!&mdash;at my expense,
and as my daughters live, brought you here
to New York?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That begun it, Uncle,&#8221; said Helen, coolly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Preposterous! What could Prince Morrell
be thinking of? Why should I support you,
Miss?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, that don&#8217;t matter so much,&#8221; remarked
Helen, calmly. &#8220;I can earn my keep, I reckon.
If there&#8217;s nothing to do in the house I&#8217;ll go and
find me a job and pay my board. But, you see,
dad thought I ought to have the refining influences
of city life. Good idea; eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A very ridiculous idea! A very ridiculous
idea, indeed!&#8221; cried Mr. Starkweather. &#8220;I never
heard the like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see, there&#8217;s another reason why I
came, too, Uncle,&#8221; Helen said, blandly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; demanded the gentleman,
startled again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, dad told me everything when he died.
He&mdash;he told me how he got into trouble before
he left New York&mdash;&#8217;way back there before I was
born,&#8221; spoke Helen, softly. &#8220;It troubled dad all
his life, Uncle Starkweather. Especially after
mother died. He feared he had not done right
by her and me, after all, in running away when
he was not guilty&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not guilty!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not guilty,&#8221; repeated Helen, sternly. &#8220;Of
course, we all know <i>that</i>. Somebody got all that
money the firm had in bank; but it was not my
father, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gazed straight into the face of Mr. Starkweather.
He did not seem to be willing to look
at her in return; nor could he pluck up the courage
to deny her statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; he finally murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the second reason that has brought me
to New York,&#8221; said Helen, more softly. &#8220;And
it is the more important reason. If you don&#8217;t care
to have me here, Uncle, I will find work that will
support me, and live elsewhere. But I <i>must</i> learn
the truth about that old story against father. I
sha&#8217;n&#8217;t leave New York until I have cleared his
name.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>SADIE AGAIN</h3>
</div>

<p>Mr. Starkweather appeared to recover his
equanimity. He looked askance at his niece, however,
as she announced her intention.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are very young and very foolish, Helen&mdash;ahem!
A mystery of sixteen or seventeen years&#8217;
standing, which the best detectives could not unravel,
is scarcely a task to be attempted by a mere
girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who else is there to do it?&#8221; Helen demanded,
quickly. &#8220;I mean to find out the truth, if I can.
I want you to tell me all you know, and I want you
to tell me how to find Fenwick Grimes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense, nonsense, girl!&#8221; exclaimed her
uncle, testily. &#8220;What good would it do you to
find Grimes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was the other partner in the concern. He
had just as good a chance to steal the money as
father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ridiculous! Mr. Grimes was away from the
city at the time.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then you <i>do</i> remember all about it, sir?&#8221;
asked Helen, quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahem! <i>That</i> fact had not slipped my mind,&#8221;
replied her uncle, weakly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then, there was Allen Chesterton, the
bookkeeper. Was a search ever made for him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;High and low,&#8221; returned her uncle, promptly.
&#8220;But nobody ever heard of him thereafter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And why did the shadow of suspicion not fall
upon him as strongly as it did upon my father?&#8221;
cried the girl, dropping, in her earnestness, her assumed
uncouthness of speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it did&mdash;perhaps it did,&#8221; muttered Mr.
Starkweather. &#8220;Yes, of course it did! They both
ran away, you see&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you advise dad to go away&mdash;until the
matter could be cleared up?&#8221; demanded Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;I&mdash;ahem!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Both you and Mr. Grimes advised it,&#8221; went
on the girl, quite firmly. &#8220;And father did so because
of the effect his arrest might have upon
mother in her delicate health. Wasn&#8217;t that the
way it was?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I presume that is so,&#8221; agreed Mr. Starkweather.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it was wrong,&#8221; declared the girl, with all
the confidence of youth. &#8220;Poor dad realized it
before he died. It made all the firm&#8217;s creditors
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
believe that he was guilty. No matter what he did
thereafter&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop, girl!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Starkweather.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know that if you stir up this old
business the scandal will all come to light?
Why&mdash;why, even <i>my</i> name might be attached
to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But poor dad suffered under the blight of it
all for more than sixteen years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahem! It is a fact. It was a great misfortune.
Perhaps he <i>was</i> advised wrongly,&#8221; said Mr.
Starkweather, with trembling lips. &#8220;But I want
you to understand, Helen, that if he had not left
the city he would undoubtedly have been in a cell
when you were born.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that that would have killed me&mdash;especially,
if by staying here, he might have come
to trial and been freed of suspicion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he could not be freed of suspicion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not? I don&#8217;t see that the evidence was
conclusive,&#8221; declared the girl, hotly. &#8220;At least,
<i>he</i> knew of none such. And I want to know now
every bit of evidence that could be brought against
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Useless! Useless!&#8221; muttered her uncle, wiping
his brow.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not useless. My father was accused of a
crime of which he wasn&#8217;t guilty. Why, his friends
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
here&mdash;those who knew him in the old days&mdash;will
think me the daughter of a criminal!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you are not likely to meet any of
them&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; demanded Helen, quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely you do not expect to remain here in
New York long enough for that?&#8221; said Uncle
Starkweather, exasperated. &#8220;I tell you, I cannot
permit it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must learn what I can about that old trouble
before I go back&mdash;if I go back to Montana at all,&#8221;
declared his niece, doggedly.</p>
<p>Mr. Starkweather was silent for a few moments.
He had begun the discussion with the settled intention
of telling Helen that she must return at
once to the West. But he knew he had no real
right of control over the girl, and to claim one
would put him at the disadvantage, perhaps, of
being made to support her.</p>
<p>He saw she was a very determined creature,
young as she was. If he antagonized her too
much, she might, indeed, go out and get a position
to support herself and remain a continual thorn
in the side of the family.</p>
<p>So he took another tack. He was not a successful
merchant and real estate operator for nothing.
He said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not blame you, Helen, for <i>wishing</i> that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
that old cloud over your father&#8217;s name might be
dissipated. I wish so, too. But, remember, long
ago your&mdash;ahem!&mdash;your aunt and I, as well as
Fenwick Grimes, endeavored to get to the bottom
of the mystery. Detectives were hired. Everything
possible was done. And to no avail.&#8221;</p>
<p>She watched him narrowly, but said nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, how can you be expected to do now what
was impossible when the matter was fresh?&#8221;
pursued her uncle, suavely. &#8220;If I could help
you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can,&#8221; declared the girl, suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you tell me how?&#8221; he asked, in a rather
vexed tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;By telling me where to find Mr. Grimes,&#8221; said
Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;er&mdash;that is easily done, although I
have had no dealings with Mr. Grimes for many
years. But if he is at home&mdash;he travels over
the country a great deal&mdash;I can give you a letter
to him and he will see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are determined to try to rake up all this
trouble?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will see Mr. Grimes. And I will try to find
Allen Chesterton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of the question!&#8221; cried her uncle.
&#8220;Chesterton is dead. He dropped out of sight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
long ago. A strange character at best, I believe.
And if he was the thief&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He certainly would not help you convict himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not intentionally, sir,&#8221; admitted Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never did see such an opinionated girl,&#8221;
cried Mr. Starkweather, in sudden wrath.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, sir, if I trouble you. If you don&#8217;t
want me here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, her uncle had decided that it would not
be safe to have the girl elsewhere in New York.
At least, if she was under his roof, he could keep
track of her activities. He began to be a little
afraid of this very determined, unruffled young
woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a little savage! No knowing what she
might do, after all,&#8221; he thought.</p>
<p>Finally he said aloud: &#8220;Well, Helen, I will do
what I can. I will communicate with Mr. Grimes
and arrange for you to visit him&mdash;soon. I will tell
you&mdash;ahem!&mdash;in the near future, all I can recollect
of the affair. Will that satisfy you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will take it very kindly of you, Uncle,&#8221; said
Helen non-committally.</p>
<p>&#8220;And when you are satisfied of the impossibility
of your doing yourself, or your father&#8217;s name, any
good in this direction, I shall expect you to close
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
your visit in the East here and return to your
friends in Montana.&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded, looking at him with a strange expression
on her shrewd face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean to help me as a sort of a bribe,&#8221; she
observed, slowly. &#8220;To pay you I am to return
home and never trouble you any more?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;er&mdash;ahem!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that it, Uncle Starkweather?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, my dear,&#8221; he began again, rather
red in the face, but glad that he was getting out of
a bad corner so easily, &#8220;you do not just fit in, here,
with our family life. You see it yourself, perhaps?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I do, sir,&#8221; replied the girl from Sunset
Ranch.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would be quite at a disadvantage beside
my girls&mdash;ahem! You would not be happy here.
And of course, you haven&#8217;t a particle of claim
upon us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir; not a particle,&#8221; repeated Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you see, all things considered, it would be
much better for you to return to your own people&mdash;ahem&mdash;<i>own
people</i>,&#8221; said Mr. Starkweather,
with emphasis. &#8220;Now&mdash;er&mdash;you are rather
shabby, I fear, Helen. I am not as rich a man as
you may suppose. But I&mdash;&mdash; The fact is, the girls
are ashamed of your appearance,&#8221; he pursued,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
without looking at her, and opening his bill
case.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is ten dollars. I understand that a
young miss like you can be fitted very nicely to a
frock downtown for less than ten dollars. I advise
you to go out to-morrow and find yourself a
more up-to-date frock than&mdash;than that one you
have on, for instance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody might see you come into the house&mdash;ahem!&mdash;some
of our friends, I mean, and they
would not understand. Get a new dress, Helen.
While you are here look your best. Ahem! We
all must give the hostage of a neat appearance to
society.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said Helen, simply.</p>
<p>She took the money. Her throat had contracted
so that she could not thank him for it in words.
But she retained a humble, thankful attitude, and
it sufficed.</p>
<p>He cared nothing about hurting the feelings of
the girl. He did not even inquire&mdash;in his own
mind&mdash;if she <i>had</i> any feelings to be hurt! He was
so self-centred, so pompous, so utterly selfish, that
he never thought how he might wrong other
people.</p>
<p>Willets Starkweather was very tenacious of his
own dignity and his own rights. But for the
rights of others he cared not at all. And there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
was not an iota of tenderness in his heart for the
orphan who had come so trustingly across the
continent and put herself in his charge. Indeed,
aside from a feeling of something like fear of
Helen, he betrayed no interest in her at all.</p>
<p>Helen went out of the room without a further
word. She was more subdued that evening at dinner
than she had been before. She did not break
out in rude speeches, nor talk very much. But she
was distinctly out of her element&mdash;or so her cousins
thought&mdash;at their dinner table.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you what it is, girls,&#8221; Belle, the oldest
cousin, said after the meal and when Helen had
gone up to her room without being invited to join
the family for the evening, &#8220;I tell you what it is:
If we chance to have company to dinner while she
remains, I shall send a tray up to her room with
her dinner on it. I certainly could not <i>bear</i> to have
the Van Ramsdens, or the De Vornes, see her at
our table.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite true,&#8221; agreed Hortense. &#8220;We never
could explain having such a cousin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Horrors, no!&#8221; gasped Flossie.</p>
<p>Helen had found a book in the library, and she
lit the gas in her room (there was no electricity
on this upper floor) and forgot her troubles and
unhappiness in following the fortunes of the
heroine of her story-book. It was late when she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
heard the maids retire. They slept in rooms
opening out of a side hall.</p>
<p>By and by&mdash;after the clock in the Metropolitan
tower had struck the hour of eleven&mdash;Helen heard
the rustle and step outside her door which she had
heard in the corridor downstairs. She crept to
her door, after turning out her light, and opening
it a crack, listened.</p>
<p>Had somebody gone downstairs? Was that a
rustling dress in the corridor down there&mdash;the
ghost walk? Did she hear again the &#8220;step&mdash;put;
step&mdash;put&#8221; that had puzzled her already?</p>
<p>She did not like to go out into the hall and, perhaps,
meet one of the servants. So, after a time,
she went back to her book.</p>
<p>But the incident had given her a distaste for
reading. She kept listening for the return of the
ghostly step. So she undressed and went to bed.
Long afterward (or so it seemed to her, for she
had been asleep and slept soundly) she was aroused
again by the &#8220;step&mdash;put; step&mdash;put&#8221; past her
door.</p>
<p>Half asleep as she was, she jumped up and ran
to the door. When she opened it, it seemed as
though the sound was far down the main corridor&mdash;and
she thought she could see the entire length
of that passage. At least, there was a great window
at the far end, and the moonlight looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
ghostily in. No shadow crossed this band of light,
and yet the rustle and step continued after she
reached her door and opened it.</p>
<p>Then&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Was that a door closed softly in the distance?
She could not be sure. After a minute or two one
thing she <i>was</i> sure of, however; she was getting
cold here in the draught, so she scurried back to
bed, covered her ears, and went to sleep again.</p>
<p>Helen got up the next morning with one well-defined
determination. She would put into practice
her uncle&#8217;s suggestion. She would buy one of
the cheap but showy dresses which shopgirls and
minor clerks had to buy to keep up appearances.</p>
<p>It was a very serious trouble to Helen that she
was not to buy and disport herself in pretty frocks
and hats. The desire to dress prettily and tastefully
is born in most girls&mdash;just as surely as is the
desire to breathe. And Helen was no exception.</p>
<p>She was obstinate, however, and could keep to
her purpose. Let the Starkweathers think she was
poor. Let them continue to think so until her
play was all over and she was ready to go home
again.</p>
<p>Her experience in the great city had told Helen
already that she could never be happy there. She
longed for the ranch, and for the Rose pony&mdash;even
for Big Hen Billings and Sing and the rag-head,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
Jo-Rab, and Manuel and Jose, and all the
good-hearted, honest &#8220;punchers&#8221; who loved her
and who would no more have hurt her feelings
than they would have made an infant cry.</p>
<p>She longed to have somebody call her
&#8220;Snuggy&#8221; and to smile upon her in good-fellowship.
As she walked the streets nobody appeared
to heed her. If they did, their expression of
countenance merely showed curiosity, or a scorn of
her clothes.</p>
<p>She was alone. She had never felt so much
alone when miles from any other human being, as
she sometimes had been on the range. What had
Dud said about this? That one could be very
much alone in the big city? Dud was right.</p>
<p>She wished that she had Dud Stone&#8217;s address.
She surely would have communicated with him
now, for he was probably back in New York by this
time.</p>
<p>However, there was just one person whom she
had met in New York who seemed to the girl from
Sunset Ranch as being &#8220;all right.&#8221; And when she
made up her mind to do as her uncle had directed
about the new frock, it was of this person Helen
naturally thought.</p>
<p>Sadie Goronsky! The girl who had shown herself
so friendly the night Helen had come to town.
She worked in a store where they sold ladies&#8217; clothing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
With no knowledge of the cheaper department
stores than those she had seen on the avenue,
it seemed quite the right thing to Helen&#8217;s mind for
her to search out Sadie and her store.</p>
<p>So, after an early breakfast taken in Mr. Lawdor&#8217;s
little room, and under the ministrations of
that kind old man, Helen left the house&mdash;by the
area door as requested&mdash;and started downtown.</p>
<p>She didn&#8217;t think of riding. Indeed, she had no
idea how far Madison Street was. But she remembered
the route the taxicab had taken uptown
that first evening, and she could not easily
lose her way.</p>
<p>And there was so much for the girl from the
ranch to see&mdash;so much that was new and curious to
her&mdash;that she did not mind the walk; although it
took her until almost noon, and she was quite tired
when she got to Chatham Square.</p>
<p>Here she timidly inquired of a policeman, who
kindly crossed the wide street with her and showed
her the way. On the southern side of Madison
Street she wandered, curiously alive to everything
about the district, and the people in it, that made
them both seem so strange to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;A dress, lady! A hat, lady!&#8221;</p>
<p>The buxom Jewish girls and women, who paraded
the street before the shops for which they
worked, would give her little peace. Yet it was all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
done good-naturedly, and when she smiled and
shook her head they smiled, too, and let her pass.</p>
<p>Suddenly she saw the sturdy figure of Sadie
Goronsky right ahead. She had stopped a rather
over-dressed, loud-voiced woman with a child, and
Helen heard a good deal of the conversation while
she waited for Sadie (whose back was toward her)
to be free.</p>
<p>The &#8220;puller-in&#8221; and the possible customer
wrangled some few moments, both in Yiddish and
broken English; but Sadie finally carried her point&mdash;and
the child&mdash;into the store! The woman had
to follow her offspring, and once inside some of
the clerks got hold of her and Sadie could come
forth to lurk for another possible customer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, see who&#8217;s here!&#8221; exclaimed the Jewish
girl, catching sight of Helen. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter,
Miss? Did they turn you out of your uncle&#8217;s
house upon Madison Avenyer? I never <i>did</i> expect
to see you again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I expected to see you again, Sadie; I told
you I&#8217;d come,&#8221; said Helen, simply.</p>
<p>&#8220;So it wasn&#8217;t just a josh; eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I always keep my word,&#8221; said the girl from
the West.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chee!&#8221; gasped Sadie. &#8220;We ain&#8217;t so partic&#8217;lar
around here. But I&#8217;m glad to see you, Miss,
just the same. Be-lieve me!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>A NEW WORLD</h3>
</div>

<p>The two girls stood on the sidewalk and let the
tide of busy humanity flow by unnoticed. Both
were healthy types of youth&mdash;one from the open
ranges of the Great West, the other from a land
far, far to the East.</p>
<p>Helen Morrell was brown, smiling, hopeful-looking;
but she certainly was not &#8220;up to date&#8221;
in dress and appearance. The black-eyed and
black-haired Russian girl was just as well developed
for her age and as rugged as she could
be; but in her cheap way her frock was the &#8220;very
latest thing,&#8221; her hair was dressed wonderfully,
and the air of &#8220;city smartness&#8221; about her made
the difference between her and Helen even more
marked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never s&#8217;posed you&#8217;d come down here,&#8221; said
Sadie again.</p>
<p>&#8220;You asked was I turned out of my uncle&#8217;s
house,&#8221; responded Helen, seriously. &#8220;Well, it
does about amount to that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! Never!&#8221; cried the other girl.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Let me tell you,&#8221; said Helen, whose heart was
so full that she longed for a confidant. Besides,
Sadie Goronsky would never know the Starkweather
family and their friends, and she felt
free to speak fully. So, without much reserve, she
related her experiences in her uncle&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, ain&#8217;t they the mean things!&#8221; ejaculated
Sadie, referring to the cousins. &#8220;And I suppose
they&#8217;re awful rich?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I presume so. The house is very large,&#8221; declared
Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;And they&#8217;ve got loads and loads of dresses,
too?&#8221; demanded the working girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. They are very fashionably dressed,&#8221;
Helen told her. &#8220;But see! I am going to have a
new dress myself. Uncle Starkweather gave me
ten dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chee!&#8221; ejaculated Sadie. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it give
him a cramp in his pocket-book to part with so
much mazouma?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mazouma?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Hebrew for money,&#8221; laughed Sadie.
&#8220;But you <i>do</i> need a dress. Where did you get
that thing you&#8217;ve got on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Out home,&#8221; replied Helen. &#8220;I see it isn&#8217;t
very fashionable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say! we got through sellin&#8217; them things to
greenies two years back,&#8221; declared Sadie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t been at work all that time; have
you?&#8221; gasped the girl from the ranch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. I got my working papers four years
ago. You see, I looked a lot older than I really
was, and comin&#8217; across from the old country all
us children changed our ages, so&#8217;t we could go
right to work when we come here without having
to spend all day in school. We had an uncle what
come over first, and he told us what to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen listened to this with some wonder. She
felt perfectly safe with Sadie, and would have
trusted her, if it were necessary, with the money
she had hidden away in her closet at Uncle Starkweather&#8217;s;
yet the other girl looked upon the laws
of the land to which she had come for freedom
as merely harsh rules to be broken at one&#8217;s convenience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Sadie, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t work on the
sidewalk here at first. I worked back in Old
Yawcob&#8217;s shop&mdash;making changes in the garments
for fussy customers. I was always quick with my
needle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I helped the salesladies. But business
was slack, and people went right by our door, and
I jumped out one day and started to pull &#8217;em in.
And I was better at it&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-day, ma&#8217;am! Will you look at a beautiful
skirt&mdash;just the very latest style&mdash;we&#8217;ve only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
got a few of them for samples?&#8221; She broke off
and left Helen to stand wondering while Sadie
chaffered with another woman, who had hesitated
a trifle as she passed the shop.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, ma&#8217;am! You was no greenie. I could
tell that at once. That&#8217;s why I spoke English to
you yet,&#8221; Sadie said, flattering the prospective
buyer, and smiling at her pleasantly. &#8220;If you will
just step in and see these skirts&mdash;or a two-piece
suit if you will?&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen observed her new friend with amazement.
Although she knew Sadie could be no older than
herself, she used the tact of long business experience
in handling the woman. And she got her into
the store, too!</p>
<p>&#8220;I wash my hands of &#8217;em when they get inside,&#8221;
she said, laughing, and coming back to
Helen. &#8220;If Old Yawcob and his wife and his
salesladies can&#8217;t hold &#8217;em, it isn&#8217;t <i>my</i> fault, you
understand. I&#8217;m about the youngest puller-in
there is along Madison Street&mdash;although that little
hunchback in front of the millinery shop yonder
<i>looks</i> younger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t try to pull <i>me</i> in,&#8221; said Helen,
laughing. &#8220;And I&#8217;ve got ten whole dollars to
spend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. But then, you see, you&#8217;re my
friend, Miss,&#8221; said Sadie. &#8220;I want to be sure you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
get your money&#8217;s worth. So I&#8217;m going with you
when you buy your dress&mdash;that is, if you&#8217;ll let
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let you? Why, I&#8217;d dearly love to have you
advise me,&#8221; declared the Western girl. &#8220;And
don&#8217;t&mdash;<i>don&#8217;t</i>&mdash;call me &#8216;Miss.&#8217; I&#8217;m Helen Morrell,
I tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. If you say so. But, you know, you
<i>are</i> from Madison Avenyer just the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;m from a great big ranch out West.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s like a farm&mdash;yes? I gotter cousin that
works on a farm over on Long Island. It&#8217;s
a big farm&mdash;it&#8217;s eighty acres. Is that farm you
come from as big as that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen nodded and did not smile at the girl&#8217;s
ignorance. &#8220;Very much bigger than eighty acres,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;You see, it has to be, for we raise
cattle instead of vegetables.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess I don&#8217;t know much about it,&#8221;
admitted Sadie, frankly. &#8220;All I know is this city
and mostly this part of it down here on the East
Side. We all have to work so hard, you know.
But we&#8217;re getting along better than we did at first,
for more of us children can work.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now I want you should go home with me
for dinner, Helen&mdash;yes! It is my dinner hour
quick now; and then we will have time to pick you
out a bargain for a dress. Sure! You&#8217;ll come?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If I won&#8217;t be imposing on you?&#8221; said Helen,
slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! That&#8217;s all right. We&#8217;ll have enough
to eat <i>this</i> noon. And it ain&#8217;t so Jewish, either,
for father don&#8217;t come home till night. Father&#8217;s
awful religious; but I tell mommer she must be up-to-date
and have some &#8217;Merican style about her.
I got her to leave off her wig yet. Catch <i>me</i> wearin&#8217;
a wig when I&#8217;m married just to make me look
ugly. Not!&#8221;</p>
<p>All this rather puzzled Helen; but she was too
polite to ask questions. She knew vaguely that
Jewish people followed peculiar rabbinical laws
and customs; but what they were she had no idea.
However, she liked Sadie, and it mattered nothing
to Helen what the East Side girl&#8217;s faith or bringing
up had been. Sadie was kind, and friendly,
and was really the only person in all this big city
in whom the ranch girl could place the smallest
confidence.</p>
<p>Sadie ran into the store for a moment and soon
a big woman with an unctuous smile, a ruffled white
apron about as big as a postage stamp, and her
gray hair dressed as remarkably as Sadie&#8217;s own,
came out upon the sidewalk to take the young girl&#8217;s
place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t I sell you somedings, lady?&#8221; she said
to the waiting Helen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t you go and run <i>my</i> customer in,
Ma Finkelstein!&#8221; cried Sadie, running out and
hugging the big woman. &#8220;Helen is my friend
and she&#8217;s going home to eat mit me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Ach!</i> you are already a United Stater yet,&#8221;
declared the big woman, laughing. &#8220;Undt the
friends you have it from Number Five Av&#8217;noo&mdash;yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You guessed it pretty near right,&#8221; cried Sadie.
&#8220;Helen lives on Madison Avenyer&mdash;and it ain&#8217;t
Madison Avenyer <i>uptown</i>, neither!&#8221;</p>
<p>She slipped her hand in Helen&#8217;s and bore her off
to the tenement house in which Helen had had her
first adventure in the great city.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on up,&#8221; said Sadie, hospitably. &#8220;You
look tired, and I bet you walked clear down here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I did,&#8221; admitted Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some o&#8217; mommer&#8217;s soup mit lentils will rest
you, I bet. It ain&#8217;t far yet&mdash;only two flights.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen followed her cheerfully. But she wondered
if she was doing just right in letting this
friendly girl believe that she was just as poor as the
Starkweathers thought she was. Yet, on the other
hand, wouldn&#8217;t Sadie Goronsky have felt embarrassed
and have been afraid to be her friend, if
she knew that Helen Morrell was a very, very
wealthy girl and had at her command what would
seem to the Russian girl &#8220;untold wealth&#8221;?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pay her for this,&#8221; thought Helen, with the
first feeling of real happiness she had experienced
since leaving the ranch. &#8220;She shall never be
sorry that she was kind to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>So she followed Sadie into the humble home
of the latter on the third floor of the tenement
with a smiling face and real warmth at her heart.
In Yiddish the downtown girl explained rapidly
her acquaintance with &#8220;the Gentile.&#8221; But, as
she had told Helen, Sadie&#8217;s mother had begun to
break away from some of the traditions of her
people. She was fast becoming &#8220;a United
Stater,&#8221; too.</p>
<p>She was a handsome, beaming woman, and she
was as generous-hearted as Sadie herself. The
rooms were a little steamy, for Mrs. Goronsky
had been doing the family wash that morning.
But the table was set neatly and the food that
came on was well prepared and&mdash;to Helen&mdash;much
more acceptable than the dainties she had been
having at Uncle Starkweather&#8217;s.</p>
<p>The younger children, who appeared for the
meal, were right from the street where they had
been playing, or from work in neighboring factories,
and were more than a little grimy. But
they were not clamorous and they ate with due
regard to &#8220;manners.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ve haf nine, Mees,&#8221; said Mrs. Goronsky,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
proudly. &#8220;Undt they all are healt&#8217;y&mdash;<i>ach! so</i>
healt&#8217;y. It takes mooch to feed them yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell about it, Mommer&#8221; cried Sadie.
&#8220;It aint stylish to have big fam&#8217;lies no more.
Don&#8217;t I tell you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about that Preesident we hadt&mdash;that
Teddy Sullivan&mdash;what said big fam&#8217;lies was a
good d&#8217;ing? Aindt that enough? Sure, Sarah, a
<i>Preesident</i> iss stylish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mommer!&#8221; screamed Sadie. &#8220;You
gotcher politics mixed. &#8216;Sullivan&#8217; is the district
leader wot gifs popper a job; but &#8216;Teddy&#8217; was
the President yet. You ain&#8217;t never goin&#8217; to be real
American.&#8221;</p>
<p>But her mother only laughed. Indeed, the light-heartedness
of these poor people was a revelation
to Helen. She had supposed vaguely that very
poor people must be all the time serious, if not
actually in tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Helen, we&#8217;ll rush right back to the shop
and I&#8217;ll make Old Yawcob sell you a bargain.
She&#8217;s goin&#8217; to get her new dress, Mommer. Ain&#8217;t
that fine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure it iss,&#8221; declared the good woman.
&#8220;Undt you get her a bargain, Sarah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Don&#8217;t</i> call me &#8216;Sarah,&#8217; Mommer!&#8221; cried the
daughter. &#8220;It ain&#8217;t stylish, I tell you. Call me
&#8216;Sadie.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p>Her mother kissed her on both plump cheeks.
&#8220;What matters it, my little lamb?&#8221; she said, in
their own tongue. &#8220;Mother love makes <i>any</i> name
sweet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen did not, of course, understand these
words; but the caress, the look on their faces, and
the way Sadie returned her mother&#8217;s kiss made a
great lump come into the orphan girl&#8217;s throat.
She could hardly find her way in the dim hall to
the stairway, she was so blinded by tears.</p>

<h3>&#8220;STEP&mdash;PUT; STEP&mdash;PUT&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>An hour later Helen was dressed in a two-piece
suit, cut in what a chorus of salesladies, including
old Mrs. Finkelstein and Sadie herself, declared
were most &#8220;stylish&#8221; lines&mdash;and it did not
cost her ten dollars, either! Indeed, Sadie insisted
upon going with her to a neighboring millinery
store and purchasing a smart little hat for
$1.59, which set off the new suit very nicely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, this old hat and suit of yours is wort&#8217;
a lot more money, Helen,&#8221; declared the Russian
girl. &#8220;But they ain&#8217;t just the style, yuh see. And
style is everything to a girl. Why, nobody&#8217;d take
you for a greenie <i>now</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen was quite wise enough to know that she
had never been dressed so cheaply before; but she
recognized, too, the truth of her friend&#8217;s statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you take the dress home, and the hat.
Maybe you can find a cheap tailor who will make
over the dress. There&#8217;s enough material in it.
That&#8217;s an awful wide skirt, you know.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But I couldn&#8217;t walk in a skirt as narrow as the
one you have on, Sadie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chee! if it was stylish,&#8221; confessed Sadie, &#8220;I&#8217;d
find a way to walk in a piece of stove-pipe!&#8221; and
she giggled.</p>
<p>So Helen left for uptown with her bundles,
wearing her new suit and hat. She took a Fourth
Avenue car and got out only a block from her
uncle&#8217;s house. As she hurried through the side
street and came to the Madison Avenue corner,
she came face-to-face with Flossie, coming home
from school with a pile of books under her arm.</p>
<p>Flossie looked quite startled when she saw her
cousin. Her eyes grew wide and she swept the
natty looking, if cheaply-dressed Western girl,
with an appreciative glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness me! What fine feathers!&#8221; she
cried. &#8220;You&#8217;ve been loading up with new clothes&mdash;eh?
Say, I like that dress.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better than the caliker one?&#8221; asked Helen,
slily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not so foolish as to believe I liked
<i>that</i>,&#8221; returned Flossie, coolly. &#8220;I told Belle and
Hortense that you weren&#8217;t as dense as they seemed
to think you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks!&#8221; said Helen, drily.</p>
<p>&#8220;But that dress is just in the mode,&#8221; repeated
Flossie, with some admiration.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Your father&#8217;s kindness enabled me to get it,&#8221;
said Helen, briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; said Flossie, frankly. &#8220;I guess
it didn&#8217;t cost you much, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen did not reply to this comment; but as she
turned to go down to the basement door, Flossie
caught her by the arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you do that!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Belle
can be pretty mean sometimes. You come in at the
front door with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Helen, smiling. &#8220;You come in at
the area door with <i>me</i>. It&#8217;s easier, anyway.
There&#8217;s a maid just opening it.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the two girls entered the house together.
They were late to lunch&mdash;indeed, Helen did not
wish any; but she did not care to explain why
she was not hungry.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you, Flossie?&#8221; demanded
Hortense. &#8220;We&#8217;ve done eating, Belle
and I. And if you wish your meals here, Helen,
please get here on time for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mind your own business!&#8221; cried Flossie,
suddenly taking up the cudgels for her cousin as
well as herself. &#8220;You aren&#8217;t the boss, Hortense!
I got kept after school, anyway. And cook can
make something hot for me and Helen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You <i>need</i> to be kept after school&mdash;from the
kind of English you use,&#8221; sniffed her sister.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care! I hate the old studies!&#8221; declared
Flossie, slamming her books down upon the
table. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see why I have to go to school at
all. I&#8217;m going to ask Pa to take me out. I need
a rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which was very likely true, for Miss Flossie
was out almost every night to some party, or to
the theater, or at some place which kept her up
very late. She had no time for study, and therefore
was behind in all her classes. That day she
had been censured for it at school&mdash;and when they
took a girl to task for falling behind in studies
at <i>that</i> school, she was very far behind, indeed!</p>
<p>Flossie grumbled about her hard lot all through
luncheon. Helen kept her company; then, when
it was over, she slipped up to her own room with
her bundles. Both Hortense and Belle had taken
a good look at her, however, and they plainly approved
of her appearance.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not such a dowdy as she seemed,&#8221;
whispered Hortense to the oldest sister.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; admitted Belle. &#8220;But that&#8217;s an awful
cheap dress she bought.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess she didn&#8217;t have much to spend,&#8221;
laughed Hortense. &#8220;Pa wasn&#8217;t likely to be very
liberal. It puzzles me why he should have kept
her here at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He says it is his duty,&#8221; scoffed Belle. &#8220;Now,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
you know Pa! He never was so worried about
duty before; was he?&#8221;</p>
<p>These girls, brought up as they were, steeped
in selfishness and seeing their father likewise so
selfish, had no respect for their parent. Nor
could this be wondered at.</p>
<p>Going up to her room that afternoon Helen
met Mrs. Olstrom coming down. The housekeeper
started when she saw the young girl, and
drew back. But Helen had already seen the great
tray of dishes the housekeeper carried. And she
wondered.</p>
<p>Who took their meals up on this top floor?
The maids who slept here were all accounted for.
She had seen them about the house. And Gregson,
too. Of course Mr. Lawdor and Mrs. Olstrom
had their own rooms below.</p>
<p>Then who could it be who was being served on
this upper floor? Helen was more than a little
curious. The sounds she had heard the night before
dove-tailed in her mind with these soiled
dishes on the tray.</p>
<p>She was almost tempted to walk through the
long corridor in which she thought she had heard
the scurrying footsteps pass the night before. Yet,
suppose she was caught by Mrs. Olstrom&mdash;or by
anybody else&mdash;peering about the house?</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>That</i> wouldn&#8217;t be very nice,&#8221; mused the girl.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Because these people think I am rude and untaught,
is no reason why I should display any
<i>real</i> rudeness.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was very curious, however; the thought of
the tray-load of dishes remained in her mind all
day.</p>
<p>At dinner that night even Mr. Starkweather
gave Helen a glance of approval when she appeared
in her new frock.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahem!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I see you have taken my
advice, Helen. We none of us can afford to forget
what is due to custom. You are much more
presentable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Uncle Starkweather,&#8221; replied
Helen, demurely. &#8220;But out our way we say:
&#8216;Fine feathers don&#8217;t make fine birds.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t fret,&#8221; giggled Flossie. &#8220;Your
feather&#8217;s aren&#8217;t a bit too fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Flossie&#8217;s eyes were red, and she plainly
had been crying.</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>hate</i> the old books!&#8221; she said, suddenly.
&#8220;Pa, why do I have to go to school any more?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I am determined you shall, young
lady,&#8221; said Mr. Starkweather, firmly. &#8220;We all
have to learn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hortense doesn&#8217;t go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you are not Hortense&#8217;s age,&#8221; returned her
father, coolly. &#8220;Remember that. And I must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
have better reports of your conduct in school than
have reached me lately,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Flossie sulked over the rest of her dinner.
Helen, going up slowly to her room later, saw the
door of her youngest cousin&#8217;s room open, and
glancing in, beheld Flossie with her head on her
book, crying hard.</p>
<p>Each of these girls had a beautiful room of her
own. Flossie&#8217;s was decorated in pink, with chintz
hangings, a lovely bed, bookshelves, a desk of inlaid
wood, and everything to delight the eye and
taste of any girl. Beside the common room Helen
occupied, this of Flossie&#8217;s was a fairy palace.</p>
<p>But Helen was naturally tender-hearted. She
could not bear to see the younger girl crying. She
ventured to step inside the door and whisper:</p>
<p>&#8220;Flossie?&#8221;</p>
<p>Up came the other&#8217;s head, her face flushed and
wet and her brow a-scowl.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do <i>you</i> want?&#8221; she demanded, quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing. Unless I can help you. And if so,
<i>that</i> is what I want,&#8221; said the ranch girl, softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness me! <i>You</i> can&#8217;t help me with algebra.
What do I want to know higher mathematics
for? I&#8217;ll never have use for such knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose we can ever learn <i>too</i> much,&#8221;
said Helen, quietly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! Lots you know about it. You never
were driven to school against your will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Whenever I got a chance to go I was
glad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;d be glad, too, if I lived on a ranch,&#8221;
returned Flossie, scornfully.</p>
<p>Helen came nearer to the desk and sat down
beside her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t look a bit pretty with your eyes all
red and hot. Crying isn&#8217;t going to help,&#8221; she
said, smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose not,&#8221; grumbled Flossie, ungrateful
of tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, let me get some water and cologne and
bathe your face.&#8221; Helen jumped up and went to
the tiny bathroom. &#8220;Now, I&#8217;ll play maid for you,
Flossie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, all right,&#8221; said the younger girl. &#8220;I
suppose, as you say, crying isn&#8217;t going to help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all. No amount of tears will solve a
problem in algebra. And you let me see the questions.
You see,&#8221; added Helen, slowly, beginning
to bathe her cousin&#8217;s forehead and swollen
eyes, &#8220;we once had a very fine school-teacher at
the ranch. He was a college professor. But he
had weak lungs and he came out there to Montana
to rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good!&#8221; murmured Flossie, meaning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
bathing process, for she was not listening much
to Helen&#8217;s remarks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it would make you feel better. But
now, let me see these algebra problems. I took
it up a little when&mdash;when Professor Payton was
at the ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t!&#8221; cried Flossie, in wonder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see them,&#8221; pursued her cousin, nodding.</p>
<p>She had told the truth&mdash;as far as she went.
After Professor Payton had left the ranch and
Helen had gone to Denver to school, she had
showed a marked taste for mathematics and had
been allowed to go far ahead of her fellow-pupils
in that study.</p>
<p>Now, at a glance, she saw what was the matter
with Flossie&#8217;s attempts to solve the problems.
She slipped into a seat beside the younger girl
again and, in a few minutes, showed Flossie just
how to solve them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Helen! I didn&#8217;t suppose you knew so
much,&#8221; said Flossie, in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, <i>that</i> is something I had a chance to
learn between times&mdash;when I wasn&#8217;t roping cows
or breaking ponies,&#8221; said Helen, drily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! I don&#8217;t believe you did either of
those vulgar things,&#8221; declared Flossie, suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are mistaken. I do them both, and do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
them well,&#8221; returned Helen, gravely. &#8220;But they
are <i>not</i> vulgar. No more vulgar than your sister
Belle&#8217;s golf. It is outdoor exercise, and living outdoors
as much as one can is a sort of religion in the
West.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Flossie, who had recovered her
breath now. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care what you do outdoors.
You can do algebra in the house! And I&#8217;m real
thankful to you, Cousin Helen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are welcome, Flossie,&#8221; returned the other,
gravely; but then she went her way to her own
room at the top of the house. Flossie did not
ask her to remain after she had done all she could
for her.</p>
<p>But Helen had found plenty of reading matter
in the house. Her cousins and uncle might ignore
her as they pleased. With a good book in her
hand she could forget all her troubles.</p>
<p>Now she slipped into her kimono, propped herself
up in bed, turned the gas-jet high, and lost
herself in the adventures of her favorite heroine.
The little clock on the mantel ticked on unheeded.
The house grew still. The maids came up to bed
chattering. But still Helen read on.</p>
<p>She had forgotten the sounds she had heard
in the old house at night. Mrs. Olstrom had mentioned
that there were &#8220;queer stories&#8221; about the
Starkweather mansion. But Helen would not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
have thought of them at this time, had something
not rattled her doorknob and startled her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody wants to come in,&#8221; was the girl&#8217;s
first thought, and she hopped out of bed and ran
to unlock it.</p>
<p>Then she halted, with her hand upon the knob.
A sound outside had arrested her. But it was not
the sound of somebody trying the latch.</p>
<p>Instead she plainly heard the mysterious &#8220;step&mdash;put;
step&mdash;put&#8221; again. Was it descending the
stairs? It seemed to grow fainter as she listened.</p>
<p>At length the girl&mdash;somewhat shaken&mdash;reached
for the key of her door again, and turned it. Then
she opened it and peered out.</p>
<p>The corridor was faintly illuminated. The
stairway itself was quite dark, for there was no
light in the short passage below called &#8220;the ghost-walk.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl, in her slippers, crept to the head of the
flight. There she could hear the steady, ghostly
footstep from below. No other sound within
the great mansion reached her ears. It <i>was</i> queer.</p>
<p>To and fro the odd step went. It apparently
drew nearer, then receded&mdash;again and again.</p>
<p>Helen could not see any of the corridor from
the top of the flight. So she began to creep down,
determined to know for sure if there really was
something or somebody there.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>Nor was she entirely unafraid now. The mysterious
sounds had got upon her nerves. Whether
they were supernatural, or natural, she was determined
to solve the mystery here and now.</p>
<p>Half-way down the stair she halted. The sound
of the ghostly step was at the far end of the hall.
But it would now return, and the girl could see
(her eyes having become used to the dim light)
more than half of the passage.</p>
<p>There was the usual rustling sound at the end
of the passage. Then the steady &#8220;step&mdash;put&#8221; approached.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>FORGOTTEN</h3>
</div>

<p>From the stair-well some little light streamed
up into the darkness of the ghost-walk. And into
this dim radiance came a little old lady&mdash;her old-fashioned
crimped hair an aureole of beautiful
gray&mdash;leaning lightly on an ebony crutch, which
in turn tapped the floor in accompaniment to her
clicking step&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Step&mdash;put; step&mdash;put; step&mdash;put.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she was out of the range of Helen&#8217;s
vision again. But she turned and came back&mdash;her
silken skirts rustling, her crutch tapping in perfect
time.</p>
<p>This was no ghost. Although slender&mdash;ethereal&mdash;almost
bird-like in her motions&mdash;the little old
lady was very human indeed. She had a pink
flush in her cheeks, and her skin was as soft as
velvet. Of course there were wrinkles; but they
were beautiful wrinkles, Helen thought.</p>
<p>She wore black half-mitts of lace, and her old-fashioned
gown was of delightfully soft, yet rich
silk. The silk was brown&mdash;not many old ladies
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
could have worn that shade of brown and found it
becoming. Her eyes were bright&mdash;the unseen girl
saw them sparkle as she turned her head, in that
bird-like manner, from side to side.</p>
<p>She was a dear, doll-like old lady! Helen
longed to hurry down the remaining steps and take
her in her arms.</p>
<p>But, instead, she crept softly back to the head
of the stairs, and slipped into her own room
again. <i>This</i> was the mystery of the Starkweather
mansion. The nightly exercise of this mysterious
old lady was the foundation for the &#8220;ghost-walk.&#8221;
The maids of the household feared the
supernatural; therefore they easily found a legend
to explain the rustling step of the old lady with the
crutch.</p>
<p>And all day long the old lady kept to her room.
That room must be in the front of the house on
this upper floor&mdash;shut away, it was likely, from
the knowledge of most of the servants.</p>
<p>Mrs. Olstrom, of course, knew about the old
lady&mdash;who she was&mdash;what she was. It was the
housekeeper who looked after the simple wants of
the mysterious occupant of the Starkweather mansion.</p>
<p>Helen wondered if Mr. Lawdor, the old butler,
knew about the mystery? And did the Starkweathers
themselves know?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>The girl from the ranch was too excited and
curious to go to sleep now. She had to remain
right by her door, opened on a crack, and learn
what would happen next.</p>
<p>For an hour at least she heard the steady stepping
of the old lady. Then the crutch rapped out
an accompaniment to her coming upstairs. She
was humming softly to herself, too. Helen,
crouched behind the door, distinguished the sweet,
cracked voice humming a fragment of the old
lullaby:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;Rock-a-by, baby, on the tree-top,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>When the wind blows, the cradle will rock,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Down will come baby&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Thus humming, and the crutch tapping&mdash;a mere
whisper of sound&mdash;the old lady rustled by Helen&#8217;s
door, on into the long corridor, and disappeared
through some door, which closed behind her and
smothered all further sound.</p>
<p>Helen went to bed; but she could not sleep&mdash;not
at first. The mystery of the little old lady and
her ghostly walk kept her eyes wide open and
her brain afire for hours.</p>
<p>She asked question after question into the dark
of the night, and only imagination answered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
Some of the answers were fairly reasonable; others
were as impossible as the story of Jack the Giant
Killer.</p>
<p>Finally, however, Helen dropped asleep. She
awoke at her usual hour&mdash;daybreak&mdash;and her
eager mind began again asking questions about the
mystery. She went down in her outdoor clothes
for a morning walk, with the little old lady uppermost
in her thoughts.</p>
<p>As usual, Mr. Lawdor was on the lookout for
her. The shaky old man loved to have her that
few minutes in his room in the early morning.
Although he always presided over the dinner, with
Gregson under him, the old butler seldom seemed
to speak, or be spoken to. Helen understood that,
like Mrs. Olstrom, Lawdor was a relic of the late
owner&mdash;Mr. Starkweather&#8217;s great-uncle&#8217;s&mdash;household.</p>
<p>Cornelius Starkweather had been a bachelor.
The mansion had descended to him from a member
of the family who had been a family man. But
that family had died young&mdash;wife and all&mdash;and
the master had handed the old homestead over to
Mr. Cornelius and had gone traveling himself&mdash;to
die in a foreign land.</p>
<p>Once Helen had heard Lawdor murmur something
about &#8220;Mr. Cornelius&#8221; and she had picked
up the remainder of her information from things
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
she had heard Mr. Starkweather and the girls
say.</p>
<p>Now the old butler met her with an ingratiating
smile and begged her to have something beside
her customary coffee and roll.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a lovely steak, Miss. The butcher
remembers me once in a while, and he knows I
am fond of a bit of tender beef. My teeth are
not what they were once, you know, Miss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why should I eat your nice steak?&#8221; demanded
Helen, laughing at him. &#8220;My teeth are
good for what the boys on the range call &#8216;bootleg.&#8217;
That&#8217;s steak cut right next to the hoof!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, but, Miss! There is so much more than I
could possibly eat,&#8221; he urged.</p>
<p>He had already turned the electricity into his
grill. The ruddy steak&mdash;salted, peppered, with
tiny flakes of garlic upon it&mdash;he brought from his
own little icebox. The appetizing odor of the
meat sharpened Helen&#8217;s appetite even as she sipped
the first of her coffee.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll just <i>have</i> to eat some, I expect, Mr. Lawdor,&#8221;
she said. Then she had a sudden thought,
and added: &#8220;Or perhaps you&#8217;d like to save this
tidbit for the little old lady in the attic?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Lawdor turned&mdash;not suddenly; he never
did anything with suddenness; but it was plain she
had startled him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Bless me, Miss&mdash;bless me&mdash;bless me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He trailed off in his usual shaky way; but his
lips were white and he stared at Helen like an owl
for a full minute. Then he added:</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there a lady in the attic, Miss?&#8221; And he
said it in his most polite way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course there is, Mr. Lawdor; and you
know it. Who is she? I am only curious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I hear the maids talking about a ghost,
Miss&mdash;foolish things&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m not foolish, Mr. Lawdor,&#8221; said the
Western girl, laughing shortly. &#8220;Not that way,
at least. I heard her; last night I saw her. Next
time I&#8217;m going to speak to her&mdash;Unless it isn&#8217;t
allowed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&mdash;it isn&#8217;t allowed, Miss,&#8221; said Lawdor,
speaking softly, and with a glance at the closed
door of the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody has forbidden <i>me</i> to speak to her,&#8221;
declared Helen, boldly. &#8220;And I&#8217;m curious&mdash;mighty
curious, Mr. Lawdor. Surely she is a nice
old lady&mdash;there is nothing the matter with her?&#8221;</p>
<p>The butler touched his forehead with a shaking
finger. &#8220;A little wrong there, Miss,&#8221; he whispered.
&#8220;But Mary Boyle is as innocent and harmless
as a baby herself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you tell me about her&mdash;who she is&mdash;why
she lives up there&mdash;and all?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not here, Miss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; demanded Helen, boldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It might offend Mr. Starkweather, Miss. Not
that he has anything to do with Mary Boyle. He
had to take the old house with her in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What <i>do</i> you mean, Lawdor?&#8221; gasped Helen,
growing more and more amazed and&mdash;naturally&mdash;more
and more curious.</p>
<p>The butler flopped the steak suddenly upon the
sizzling hot plate and in another moment the delicious
bit was before her. The old man served
her as expertly as ever, but his face was working
strangely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t tell you here, Miss. Walls have
ears, they say,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;But if you&#8217;ll
be on the first bench beyond the Sixth Avenue
entrance to Central Park at ten o&#8217;clock this morning,
I will meet you there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss&mdash;the rolls. Some more butter,
Miss? I hope the coffee is to your taste, Miss?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is all very delicious, Lawdor,&#8221; said Helen,
rather weakly, and feeling somewhat confused.
&#8220;I will surely be there. I shall not need to come
back for the regular breakfast after having this
nice bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen attracted much less attention upon her
usual early morning walk this time. She was
dressed in the mode, if cheaply, and she was not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
so self-conscious. But, in addition, she thought
but little of herself or her own appearance or
troubles while she walked briskly uptown.</p>
<p>It was of the little old woman, and her mystery,
and the butler&#8217;s words that she thought. She
strode along to the park, and walked west until
she reached the bridle-path. She had found this
before, and came to see the riders as they cantered
by.</p>
<p>How Helen longed to put on her riding clothes
and get astride a lively mount and gallop up the
park-way! But she feared that, in doing so, she
might betray to her uncle or the girls the fact that
she was not the &#8220;pauper cowgirl&#8221; they thought
her to be.</p>
<p>She found a seat overlooking the path, at last,
and rested for a while; but her mind was not upon
the riders. Before ten o&#8217;clock she had walked
back south, found the entrance to the park opposite
Sixth Avenue, and sat down upon the bench
specified by the old butler. At the stroke of the
hour the old man appeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could not have walked all this way, Lawdor?&#8221;
said the girl, smiling upon him. &#8220;You
are not at all winded.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Miss. I took the car. I am not up to
such walks as you can take,&#8221; and he shook his head,
mumbling: &#8220;Oh, no, no, no, no&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And now, what can you tell me, sir?&#8221; she said,
breaking in upon his dribbling speech. &#8220;I am just
as curious as I can be. That dear little old lady!
Why is she in uncle&#8217;s house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Miss! I fancy she will not be there for
long, but she was an encumbrance upon it when
Mr. Willets Starkweather came with his family
to occupy it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What <i>do</i> you mean?&#8221; cried the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary Boyle served in the Starkweather family
long, long ago. Before I came to valet for Mr.
Cornelius, Mary Boyle had her own room and was
a fixture in the house. Mr. Cornelius took her
more&mdash;more philosophically, as you might say,
Miss. My present master and his daughters look
upon poor Mary Boyle as a nuisance. They have
to allow her to remain. She is a life charge upon
the estate&mdash;that, indeed, was fixed before Mr.
Cornelius&#8217;s time. But the present family are
ashamed of her. Perhaps I ought not to say it,
but it is true. They have relegated her to a suite
upon the top floor, and other people have quite
forgotten Mary Boyle&mdash;yes, oh, yes, indeed!
Quite forgotten her&mdash;quite forgotten her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, with the aid of some questioning, Helen
heard the whole sad story of Mary Boyle, who was
a nurse girl in the family of the older generation of
Starkweathers. It was in her arms the last baby
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
of the family had panted his weakly little life out.
She, too, had watched by the bed of the lady of
the mansion, who had borne these unfortunate
children only to see them die.</p>
<p>And Mary Boyle was one of that race who often
lose their own identity in the families they serve.
She had loved the lost babies as though they had
been of her own flesh. She had walked the little
passage at the back of the house (out of which
had opened the nursery in those days) so many,
many nights with one or the other of her fretful
charges, that by and by she thought, at night,
that she had them yet to soothe.</p>
<p>Mary Boyle, the weak-minded yet harmless ex-nurse,
had been cherished by her old master. And
in his will he had left her to the care of Mr.
Cornelius, the heir. In turn she had been left a
life interest in the mansion&mdash;to the extent of shelter
and food and proper clothes&mdash;when Willets
Starkweather became proprietor.</p>
<p>He could not get rid of the old lady. But,
when he refurnished the house and made it over,
he had banished Mary Boyle to the attic rooms.
The girls were ashamed of her. She sometimes
talked loudly if company was about. And always
of the children she had once attended. She spoke
of them as though they were still in her care, and
told how she had walked the hall with one, or the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
other, of her dead and gone treasures the very
night before!</p>
<p>For it was found necessary to allow Mary
Boyle to have the freedom of that short corridor
on the chamber floor late at night. Otherwise she
would not remain secluded in her own rooms at the
top of the house during the daytime.</p>
<p>As the lower servants came and went, finally
only Mrs. Olstrom and Mr. Lawdor knew about
the old lady, save the family. And Mr. Starkweather
impressed it upon the minds of both these
employés that he did not wish the old lady discussed
below stairs.</p>
<p>So the story had risen that the house was
haunted. The legend of the &#8220;ghost walk&#8221; was
established. And Mary Boyle lived out her lonely
life, with nobody to speak to save the housekeeper,
who saw her daily; Mr. Lawdor, who climbed to
her rooms perhaps once each week, and Mr.
Starkweather himself, who saw and reported upon
her case to his fellow trustees each month.</p>
<p>It was, to Helen, an unpleasant story. It threw
a light on the characters of her uncle and cousins
which did not enhance her admiration of them, to
say the least. She had found them unkind, purse-proud
heretofore; but to her generous soul their
treatment of the little old woman, who must be
but a small charge upon the estate, seemed far
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
more blameworthy than their treatment of herself.</p>
<p>The story of the old butler made Helen quiver
with indignation. It was like keeping the old lady
in jail&mdash;this shutting her away into the attic of the
great house. The Western girl went back to
Madison Avenue (she walked, but the old butler
rode) with a thought in her mind that she was not
quite sure was a wise one. Yet she had nobody
to discuss her idea with&mdash;nobody whom she wished
to take into her confidence.</p>
<p>There were two lonely and neglected people in
that fine mansion. She, herself, was one. The
old nurse, Mary Boyle, was the other. And Helen
felt a strong desire to see and talk with her
fellow-sufferer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>A DISTINCT SHOCK</h3>
</div>

<p>That evening when Mr. Starkweather came
home, he handed Helen a sealed letter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have ascertained,&#8221; the gentleman said, in his
most pompous way, &#8220;that Mr. Fenwick Grimes
is in town. He has recently returned from a tour
of the West, where he has several mining interests.
You will find his address on that envelope. Give
the letter to him. It will serve to introduce you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He watched her closely while he said this, but
did not appear to do so. Helen thanked him with
some warmth.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is very good of you, Uncle Starkweather&mdash;especially
when I know you do not approve.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahem! Sleeping dogs are much better left
alone. To stir a puddle is only to agitate the
mud. This old business would much better be forgotten.
You know all that there is to be known
about the unfortunate affair, I am quite sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot believe that, Uncle,&#8221; Helen replied.
&#8220;Had you seen how my dear father worried about
it when he was dying&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></p>
<p>Mr. Starkweather could look at her no
longer&mdash;not even askance. He shook his head
and murmured some commonplace, sympathetic
phrase. But it did not seem genuine to his
niece.</p>
<p>She knew very well that Mr. Starkweather had
no real sympathy for her; nor did he care a particle
about her father&#8217;s death. But she tucked the
letter into her pocket and went her way.</p>
<p>As she passed through the upstairs corridor
Flossie was entering one of the drawing-rooms,
and she caught her cousin by the hand. Flossie
had been distinctly nicer to Helen&mdash;in private&mdash;since
the latter had helped her with the algebra
problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on in, Helen. Belle&#8217;s just pouring tea.
Don&#8217;t you want some?&#8221; said the youngest Starkweather
girl.</p>
<p>It was in Helen&#8217;s mind to excuse herself. Yet
she was naturally too kindly to refuse to accept an
advance like this. And she, like Flossie, had no
idea that there was anybody in the drawing-room
save Belle and Hortense.</p>
<p>In they marched&mdash;and there were three young
ladies&mdash;friends of Belle&mdash;sipping tea and eating
macaroons by the log fire, for the evening was
drawing in cold.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness me!&#8221; ejaculated Belle.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I never!&#8221; gasped Hortense. &#8220;Have
<i>you</i> got to butt in, Floss?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We want some tea, too,&#8221; said the younger
girl, boldly, angered by her sisters&#8217; manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better have it in the nursery,&#8221; yawned
Hortense. &#8220;This is no place for kids in the
bread-and-butter stage of growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, is that so?&#8221; cried Flossie. &#8220;Helen and I
are not kids&mdash;distinctly <i>not</i>! I hope I know my
way about a bit&mdash;and as for Helen,&#8221; she added,
with a wicked grin, knowing that the speech would
annoy her sisters, &#8220;Helen can shoot, and rope
steers, and break ponies to saddle, and all that.
She told me so the other evening. Isn&#8217;t that
right, Cousin Helen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, your cousin must be quite a wonderful
girl,&#8221; said Miss Van Ramsden, one of the visitors,
to Flossie. &#8220;Introduce me; won&#8217;t you, Flossie?&#8221;</p>
<p>Belle was furious; and Hortense would have
been, too, only she was too languid to feel such
an emotion. Flossie proceeded to introduce
Helen to the three visitors&mdash;all of whom chanced
to be young ladies whom Belle was striving her
best to cultivate.</p>
<p>And before Flossie and Helen had swallowed
their tea, which Belle gave them ungraciously,
Gregson announced a bevy of other girls, until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
quite a dozen gaily dressed and chattering misses
were gathered before the fire.</p>
<p>At first Helen had merely bowed to the girls
to whom she was introduced. She had meant to
drink her tea quietly and excuse herself. She did
not wish now to display a rude manner before
Belle&#8217;s guests; but her oldest cousin seemed determined
to rouse animosity in her soul.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;Helen is paying us a little
visit&mdash;a very brief one. She is not at all used
to our ways. In fact, Indian squaws and what-do-you
call-&#8217;ems&mdash;Greasers&mdash;are about all the people
she sees out her way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; cried Miss Van Ramsden. &#8220;It
must be a perfectly charming country. Come and
sit down by me, Miss Morrell, and tell me about
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, at the moment, there was only one
vacant chair handy, and that was beside Miss Van
Ramsden. So Helen took it and immediately the
young lady began to ask questions about Montana
and the life Helen had lived there.</p>
<p>Really, the young society woman was not offensive;
the questions were kindly meant. But Helen
saw that Belle was furious and she began to take
a wicked delight in expatiating upon her home and
her own outdoor accomplishments.</p>
<p>When she told Miss Van Ramsden how she and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
her cowboy friends rode after jack-rabbits and
roped them&mdash;if they could!&mdash;and shot antelope
from the saddle, and that the boys sometimes attacked
a mountain lion with nothing but their
lariats, Miss Van Ramsden burst out with:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, that&#8217;s perfectly grand! What fun you
must have! Do hear her, girls! Why, what we
do is tame and insipid beside things that happen
out there in Montana every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t bother about her, May!&#8221; cried
Belle. &#8220;Come on and let&#8217;s plan what we&#8217;ll do
Saturday if we go to the Nassau links.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen here!&#8221; cried Miss Van Ramsden,
eagerly. &#8220;Golf can wait. We can always golf.
But your cousin tells the very bulliest stories. Go
on, Miss Morrell. Tell some more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do, do!&#8221; begged some of the other girls,
drawing their chairs nearer.</p>
<p>Helen was not a little embarrassed. She would
have been glad to withdraw from the party. But
then she saw the looks exchanged between Belle
and Hortense, and they fathered a wicked desire
in the Western girl&#8217;s heart to give her proud
cousins just what they were looking for.</p>
<p>She began, almost unconsciously, to stretch her
legs out in a mannish style, and drop into the drawl
of the range.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coyote running is about as good fun as we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
have,&#8221; she told Miss Van Ramsden in answer to
a question. &#8220;Yes, they&#8217;re cowardly critters; but
they can run like a streak o&#8217; greased lightning&mdash;yes-sir-ree-bob!&#8221;
Then she began to laugh a little.
&#8220;I remember once when I was a kid, that
I got fooled about coyotes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to know what you are now,&#8221; drawled
Hortense, trying to draw attention from her cousin,
who was becoming altogether too popular.
&#8220;And you should know that children are better
seen than heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see,&#8221; said Helen, quickly, &#8220;our birthdays
are in the same month; aren&#8217;t they, &#8217;Tense?
I believe mother used to tell me so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, never mind your birthdays,&#8221; urged Miss
Van Ramsden, while some of the other girls
smiled at the repartee. &#8220;Let&#8217;s hear about your
adventure with the coyote, Miss Morrell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, ye see,&#8221; said Helen, &#8220;it wasn&#8217;t much.
I was just a kid, as I say&mdash;mebbe ten year old.
Dad had given me a light rifle&mdash;just a twenty-two,
you know&mdash;to learn to shoot with. And Big Hen
Billings&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t that sound just like those dear Western
plays?&#8221; gasped one young lady. &#8220;You know&mdash;&#8216;The
Squaw Man of the Golden West,&#8217; or
&#8216;Missouri,&#8217; or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on! You&#8217;re getting your titles mixed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
Lettie,&#8221; cried Miss Van Ramsden. &#8220;Do let Miss
Morrell tell it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To give that child the center of the stage!&#8221;
snapped Hortense, to Belle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could shake Flossie for bringing her in
here,&#8221; returned the oldest Starkweather girl, quite
as angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell us about your friend, Big Hen Billings,&#8221;
drawled another visitor. &#8220;He <i>does</i> sound so romantic!&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen almost giggled. To consider the giant
foreman of Sunset Ranch a romantic type was certainly
&#8220;going some.&#8221; She had the wicked thought
that she would have given a large sum of money,
right then and there, to have had Big Hen announced
by Gregson and ushered into the presence
of this group of city girls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; continued Helen, thus urged, &#8220;father
had given me a little rifle and Big Hen gave me a
maverick&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; demanded Flossie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, in this case,&#8221; explained Helen, &#8220;it was
an orphaned calf. Sometimes they&#8217;re strays that
haven&#8217;t been branded. But in this case a bear had
killed the calf&#8217;s mother in a <i>coulée</i>. She had tried
to fight Mr. Bear, of course, or he never would
have killed her at that time of year. Bears aren&#8217;t
dangerous unless they&#8217;re hungry.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My! but they look dangerous enough&mdash;at the
zoo,&#8221; observed Flossie.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell ye,&#8221; said Helen, reflectively, &#8220;that was
a pretty calf. And I was little, and I hated to hear
them blat when the boys burned them&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Burned them! Burned little calves! How
cruel! What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>These were some of the excited comments.
And in spite of Belle and Hortense, most of the
visitors were now interested in the Western girl&#8217;s
narration.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have to brand &#8217;em, you see,&#8221; explained
Helen. &#8220;Otherwise we never could pick our cattle
out from other herds at the round-up. You
see, on the ranges&mdash;even the fenced ranges&mdash;cattle
from several ranches often get mixed up. Our
brand is the Link-A. Our ranch was known, in
the old days, as the &#8216;Link-A.&#8217; It&#8217;s only late years
that we got to calling it Sunset Ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sunset Ranch!&#8221; cried Miss Van Ramsden,
quickly. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t I heard something about <i>that</i>
ranch? Isn&#8217;t it one of the big, big cattle and horse-breeding
ranches?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said Helen, slowly, fearing
that she had unwittingly got into a blind alley of
conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;And your father owns <i>that</i> ranch?&#8221; cried
Miss Van Ramsden.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My&mdash;my father is dead,&#8221; said Helen. &#8220;I am
an orphan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear me! I am so sorry,&#8221; murmured the
wealthy young lady.</p>
<p>But here Belle broke in, rather scornfully:</p>
<p>&#8220;The child means that her father worked on
that ranch. She has lived there all her life. Quite
a rude place, I fawncy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen&#8217;s eyes snapped. &#8220;Yes. He worked
there,&#8221; she admitted, which was true enough, for
nobody could honestly have called Prince Morrell
a sluggard.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was&mdash;what you call it&mdash;a cowpuncher, I
believe,&#8221; whispered Belle, in an aside.</p>
<p>If Helen heard she made no sign, but went on
with her story.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, it was <i>such</i> a pretty calf,&#8221; she repeated.
&#8220;It had big blue eyes at first&mdash;calves
often do. And it was all sleek and brown, and
it played so cunning. Of course, its mother being
dead, I had a lot of trouble with it at first. I
brought it up by hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I tied a broad pink ribbon around its
neck, with a big bow at the back. When it slipped
around under its neck Bozie would somehow
get the end of the ribbon in its mouth, and
chew, and chew on it till it was nothing but
pulp.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></p>
<p>She laughed reminiscently, and the others,
watching her pretty face in the firelight, smiled
too.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you called it Bozie?&#8221; asked Miss Van
Ramsden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. And it followed me everywhere. If I
went out to try and shoot plover or whistlers
with my little rifle, there was Bozie tagging after
me. So, you see when it came calf-branding time,
I hid Bozie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You hid it? How?&#8221; demanded Flossie.
&#8220;Seems to me a calf would be a big thing to
hide.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t hide it under my bed,&#8221; laughed Helen.
&#8220;No, sir! I took it out to a far distant <i>coulée</i>
where I used to go to play&mdash;a long way from the
bunk-house&mdash;and I hitched Bozie to a stub of a
tree where there was nice, short, sweet grass for
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hitched him in the morning, for the branding
fires were going to be built right after dinner.
But I had to show up at dinner&mdash;sure. The whole
gang would have been out hunting me if I
didn&#8217;t report for meals.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I presume you ran perfectly wild,&#8221;
sighed Hortense, trying to look as though she
were sorry for this half-savage little cousin from
the &#8220;wild and woolly.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, very wild indeed,&#8221; drawled Helen.
&#8220;And after dinner I raced back to the <i>coulée</i> to
see that Bozie was all right. I took my rifle along
so the boys would think I&#8217;d gone hunting and
wouldn&#8217;t tell father.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d heard coyotes barking, as I thought, all
the forenoon. And when I came to the hollow,
there was Bozie running around and around his
stub, and getting all tangled up, blatting his heart
out, while two big old coyotes (or so I thought
they were) circled around him.</p>
<p>&#8220;They ran a little way when they saw me coming.
Coyotes sometimes <i>will</i> kill calves. But I
had never seen one before that wouldn&#8217;t hunt the
tall pines when they saw me coming.</p>
<p>&#8220;Crackey, those two were big fellers! I&#8217;d
seen big coyotes, but never none like them two
gray fellers. And they snarled at me when I made
out to chase &#8217;em&mdash;me wavin&#8217; my arms and hollerin&#8217;
like a Piute buck. I never had seen coyotes like
them before, and it throwed a scare into me&mdash;it
sure did!</p>
<p>&#8220;And Bozie was so scared that he helped to
scare me. I dropped my gun and started to untangle
him. And when I got him loose he acted
like all possessed!</p>

<p>&#8220;He wanted to run wild,&#8221; proceeded Helen.
&#8220;He yanked me over the ground at a great rate.
And all the time those two gray fellers was
sneakin&#8217; up behind me. Crackey, but I got
scared!</p>
<p>&#8220;A calf is awful strong&mdash;&#8217;specially when it&#8217;s
scared. You don&#8217;t know! I had to leave go
of either the rope, or the gun, and somehow,&#8221; and
Helen smiled suddenly into Miss Van Ramsden&#8217;s
face&mdash;who understood&mdash;&#8220;somehow I felt like I&#8217;d
better hang onter the gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They weren&#8217;t coyotes!&#8221; exclaimed Miss Van
Ramsden.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. They was wolves&mdash;real old, gray, timber-wolves.
We hadn&#8217;t been bothered by them for
years. Two of &#8217;em, working together, would pull
down a full-grown cow, let alone a little bit of a
calf and a little bit of a gal,&#8221; said Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;O-o-o!&#8221; squealed the excited Flossie. &#8220;But
they didn&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here to tell the tale,&#8221; returned her cousin,
laughing outright. &#8220;Bozie broke away from me,
and the wolves leaped after him&mdash;full chase. I
knelt right down&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And prayed!&#8221; gasped Flossie. &#8220;I should
think you would!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>did</i> pray&mdash;yes, ma&#8217;am! I prayed that the
bullet would go true. But I knelt down to steady
my aim,&#8221; said Helen, chuckling again. &#8220;And I
broke the back of one of them wolves with my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
first shot. That was wonderful luck&mdash;with a
twenty-two rifle. The bullet&#8217;s only a tiny thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I bowled Mr. Wolf over, and then I ran
after the other one and the blatting Bozie. Bozie
dodged the wolf somehow and came circling back
at me, his tail flirting in the air, coming in stiff-legged
jumps as a calf does, and searching his soul
for sounds to tell how scart he was!</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d pushed another cartridge into my gun.
But when Bozie came he bowled me over&mdash;flat on
my back. Then the wolf made a leap, and I saw
his light-gray underbody right over my head as he
flashed after poor Bozie.</p>
<p>&#8220;I jest let go with the gun! Crackey! I didn&#8217;t
have time to shoulder it, and it kicked and hit me
in the nose and made my nose bleed awful. I was
&#8216;all in,&#8217; too, and I thought the wolf was going to
eat Bozie, and then mebbe <i>me</i>, and I set up to
bawl so&#8217;t Big Hen heard me farther than he could
have heard my little rifle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Big Hen was always expectin&#8217; me to get inter
some kind of trouble, and he come tearin&#8217; along
lookin&#8217; for me. And there I was, rolling in the
grass an&#8217; bawling, the second wolf kicking his life
out with the blood pumping from his chest, not
three yards away from me, and Bozie streakin&#8217; it
acrost the hill, his tail so stiff with fright you could
ha&#8217; hung yer hat on it!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that perfectly grand!&#8221; cried Miss Van
Ramsden, seizing Helen by the shoulders when she
had finished and kissing her on both cheeks.
&#8220;And you only ten years old?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, you see,&#8221; said Helen, more quietly, &#8220;we
are brought up that way in Montana. We would
die a thousand deaths if we were taught to be
afraid of anything on four legs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be an exceedingly crude country,&#8221; remarked
Hortense, her nose tip-tilted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shocking!&#8221; agreed Belle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to go there,&#8221; announced Flossie, suddenly.
&#8220;I think it must be fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite right,&#8221; agreed Miss Van Ramsden.</p>
<p>The older Starkweather girls could not go
against their most influential caller. They were
only too glad to have the Van Ramsden girl come
to see them. But while the group were discussing
Helen&#8217;s story, the girl from Sunset Ranch stole
away and went up to her room.</p>
<p>She had not meant to tell about her life in the
West&mdash;not in just this way. She had tried to talk
about as her cousins expected her to, when once she
got into the story; but its effect upon the visitors
had not been just what either the Starkweather
girls, or Helen herself, had expected.</p>
<p>She saw that she was much out of the good
graces of Belle and Hortense at dinner; they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
hardly spoke to her. But Flossie seemed to delight
in rubbing her sisters against the grain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Pa,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;when Helen goes home,
let me go with her; will you? I&#8217;d just love to be
on a ranch for a while&mdash;I know I should! And I
<i>do</i> need a vacation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Floss!&#8221; gasped Hortense.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a perfectly vulgar little thing,&#8221; declared
Belle. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know where you get such
low tastes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Starkweather looked at his youngest daughter
in amazement. &#8220;How very ridiculous,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Ahem! You do not know what you ask,
Flossie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! I never can have anything I want,&#8221;
whined Miss Flossie. &#8220;And it must be great fun
out on that ranch. You ought to hear Helen tell
about it, Pa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahem! I have no interest in such things,&#8221;
said her father, sternly. &#8220;Nor should you. No
well conducted and well brought up girl would
wish to live among such rude surroundings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very true, Pa,&#8221; sighed Hortense, shrugging
her shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a very common little thing, with very
common tastes, Floss,&#8221; admonished her oldest
sister.</p>
<p>Now, all this was whipping Helen over Flossie&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
shoulders. The latter grinned wickedly; but
Helen felt hurt. These people were determined
to consider Sunset Ranch an utterly uncivilized
place, and her associates there beneath contempt.</p>
<p>The following morning she set out to find the
address upon the letter Mr. Starkweather had
given to her. Whether she should present this
letter to Mr. Grimes at once, Helen was not sure.
It might be that she would wish to get acquainted
with him before he knew her identity. Her expectations
were very vague, at best; and yet she
had hope.</p>
<p>She hoped that through this old-time partner
of her father&#8217;s she might pick up some clue to the
truth about the lost money. The firm of Grimes &amp;
Morrell had been on the point of paying several
heavy bills and notes. The money for this purpose,
as well as the working capital of the firm,
had been in two banks. Either partner could
draw checks against these accounts.</p>
<p>When the deposits in both banks had been withdrawn
it had been done by checks for each complete
balance being presented at the teller&#8217;s window
of both banks. And the tellers were quite
sure that the person presenting the checks was
Prince Morrell.</p>
<p>In the rush of business, however, neither teller
had been positive of this. Of course, it might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
have been the bookkeeper, or Mr. Grimes, who
had got the money on the checks. However it
might be, the money disappeared; there was none
with which to pay the creditors or to continue the
business of the firm.</p>
<p>Fenwick Grimes had been a sufferer; Willets
Starkweather had been a sufferer. What Allen
Chesterton, the bookkeeper, had been, it was hard
to say. He had walked out of the office of the firm
and had never come back. Likewise after a few
days of worry and disturbance, Prince Morrell
had done the same.</p>
<p>At least, the general public presumed that Mr.
Morrell had run away without leaving any clue.
It looked as though the senior partner and the
bookkeeper were in league.</p>
<p>But public interest in the mystery had soon died
out. Only the creditors remembered. After ten
years they were pleasantly reminded of the wreck
of the firm of Grimes &amp; Morrell by the receipt of
their lost money, with interest compounded to date.
The lawyer that had come on from the West to
make the settlement for Prince Morrell bound the
creditors to secrecy. The bankruptcy court had
long since absolved Fenwick Grimes from responsibility
for the debts of the old firm. Neither he
nor Mr. Starkweather had to know that the partner
who ran away had legally cleared his name.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>But there was something more. The suspicion
against Prince Morrell had burdened the cattle
king&#8217;s mind and heart when he died. And his little
daughter felt it to be her sacred duty to try, at
least, to uncover that old mystery and to prove to
the world that her father had been guiltless.</p>
<p>Mr. Grimes lived in an old house in a rather
shabby old street just off Washington Square.
Helen asked Mr. Lawdor how to find the place,
and she rode downtown upon a Fifth Avenue &#8217;bus.</p>
<p>The house was a half-business, half-studio
building; and Mr. Grimes&#8217;s name&mdash;graven on a
small brass plate&mdash;was upon a door in the lower
hall. In fact, Mr. Grimes, and his clerk, occupied
this lower floor, the gentleman owning the
building, which he was holding for a rise in real
estate values in that neighborhood.</p>
<p>The clerk, a sharp-looking young man with
a pen behind his ear, answered Helen&#8217;s somewhat
timid knock. He looked her over severely before
he even offered to admit her, asking:</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your business, please?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I came to see Mr. Grimes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By appointment?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No-o, sir. But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is very busy. He seldom sees anybody
save by appointment. Are&mdash;are you acquainted
with him?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. But my business is important.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To you, perhaps,&#8221; said the clerk, with a sneering
smile. &#8220;But if it isn&#8217;t important to <i>him</i> I shall
catch it for letting you in. What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is business that I can tell to nobody except
Mr. Grimes. Not in detail. But I can say this
much: It concerns a time when Mr. Grimes was in
business with another man&mdash;sixteen years or more
ago and I have come&mdash;come from his old partner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; said the clerk. &#8220;A begging interview?
For, if so, take my advice&mdash;don&#8217;t try it.
It would be no use. Mr. Grimes never gives anything
away. He wouldn&#8217;t even bait a rat-trap with
cheese-parings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not come here to beg money of Mr.
Grimes,&#8221; said Helen, drawing herself up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you can come in and wait. Perhaps
he&#8217;ll see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>This had all been said very low in the public
hall, the clerk holding the door jealously shut behind
him. Now he opened it slowly and let her
enter a large room, with old and dusty furniture
set about it, and the clerk&#8217;s own desk far back, by
another door&mdash;which latter he guarded against all
intrusion. Behind that door, of course, was the
man she had come to see.</p>
<p>But as Helen turned to take a seat on the couch
which the clerk indicated with a gesture of his pen,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
she suddenly discovered that she was not the only
person waiting in the room. In a decrepit armchair
by one of the front windows, and reading
the morning paper, with his wig pushed back upon
his bald brow, was the queer old gentleman with
whom she had ridden across the continent when
she had come to New York.</p>
<p>The discovery of this acquaintance here in Mr.
Grimes&#8217;s office gave Helen a distinct shock.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>PROBING FOR FACTS</h3>
</div>

<p>Helen sat down quickly and stared across the
room at the queer old man. The latter at first
seemed to pay her no attention. But finally she
saw that he was skillfully &#8220;taking stock&#8221; of her
from behind the shelter of the printed sheet.</p>
<p>The Western girl was more direct than that.
She got up and walked across to him. The clerk
uttered a very loud &#8220;Ahem!&#8221; as though to warn
her to drop her intention; but Helen said coolly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember me, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha! I believe it <i>is</i> the little girl who came
from the coast with me last week,&#8221; said the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not from the coast; from Montana,&#8221; corrected
Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you are dressed differently now and I was
not sure,&#8221; he said. &#8220;How have you been?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, I thank you. And you, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well. Very. But I did not expect to see you
again&mdash;er&mdash;<i>here</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. And you are waiting to see Mr.
Grimes, too?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Er&mdash;something like that,&#8221; admitted the old
man.</p>
<p>Helen eyed him thoughtfully. She had already
glanced covertly once or twice at the clerk across
the room. She was quite bright enough to see between
the rungs of a ladder.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> are Mr. Grimes,&#8221; she said, bluntly, looking
again at the old man, who was adjusting his
wig.</p>
<p>He looked up at her slily, his avaricious little
eyes twinkling as they had aboard the train when
he had looked over her shoulder and caught her
counting her money.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a very smart little girl,&#8221; he said, with
a short laugh. &#8220;What have you come to see me
about? Do you think of investing some of your
money in mining stocks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Helen. &#8220;I have no money to invest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph. Did you find your folks?&#8221; he asked,
turning the subject quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you, then? What do
you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You <i>are</i> Mr. Grimes?&#8221; she pursued, to make
sure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t deny it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have come to talk to you about&mdash;about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
Prince Morrell,&#8221; she said, in a very low voice so
that the clerk could not hear.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Who</i>?&#8221; gasped the man, falling back in his
chair. Evidently Helen had startled him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prince Morrell,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you to Prince Morrell?&#8221; demanded
the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am his daughter. He is dead. I have come
here to talk with you about the time&mdash;the time he
left New York,&#8221; said the girl from Sunset Ranch,
hesitatingly.</p>
<p>Mr. Grimes stared at her, with his wig still
awry, for some moments; then the color began to
come back into his face. Helen had not realized
before that he had turned pale.</p>
<p>&#8220;You come into my office,&#8221; he snapped, jumping
up briskly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get to the bottom of
this!&#8221;</p>
<p>His movements were so very abrupt and he
looked at her so strangely that, to tell the truth, the
girl from Sunset Ranch was a bit frightened. She
trailed along behind him, however, with only a
hesitating step, passing the wondering clerk, and
heard the lock of the door of the inner office snap
behind her as Mr. Grimes shut it.</p>
<p>He drew heavy curtains over the door, too.
The place was a gloomy apartment until he turned
on the electric light over a desk table. She saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
that there were curtains at all the windows, and at
the other door, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come here,&#8221; he said, beckoning her to the
desk, and to a chair that stood by it, and still
speaking softly. &#8220;We will not be overheard here.
Now! Tell me what you mean by coming to me in
this way?&#8221;</p>
<p>He shot such an ugly look at her that Helen
was again startled.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do <i>you</i> mean?&#8221; she returned, hiding
her real emotion. &#8220;I have come to ask some questions.
Why shouldn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You say Prince Morrell is dead?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. Nearly two months, now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who sent you, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sent me to you?&#8221; queried Helen, in wonder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Somebody must have sent you,&#8221; said
Mr. Grimes, watching her with his little eyes,
in which there seemed to burn a very baleful
look.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are mistaken. Nobody sent me,&#8221; said
Helen, recovering a measure of her courage. She
believed that this strange man was a coward. But
why should he be afraid of her?</p>
<p>&#8220;You came clear across this continent to interview
me about&mdash;about something that is gone
and forgotten&mdash;almost before you were born?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t forgotten,&#8221; returned Helen, meaningly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
&#8220;Such things are never forgotten. My
father said so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s no use hauling everything to the surface
of the pool again,&#8221; grumbled Mr. Grimes.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is about what Uncle Starkweather
says; but I do not feel that way,&#8221; said Helen,
slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha! Starkweather! Of course he&#8217;s in it. I
might have known,&#8221; muttered the old man. &#8220;So
<i>he</i> sent you to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. He objected to my coming,&#8221; declared
Helen, quite convinced now that she should
not deliver her uncle&#8217;s letter.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Starkweathers are the people you came
East to visit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And how did <i>they</i> receive you in their fine
Madison Avenue mansion?&#8221; queried Mr. Grimes,
looking up at her slily again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as you know they did,&#8221; returned Helen,
briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha! How&#8217;s that? And you with all
that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He halted and&mdash;for a moment&mdash;had the grace
to blush. He saw that she read his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;They do not know that I have some money
for emergencies,&#8221; said Helen, coolly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ho, ho!&#8221; chuckled Mr. Grimes, suddenly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So they consider you a pauper relative from the
West?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ho, ho!&#8221; he laughed again, and rubbed his
hands. &#8220;How <i>did</i> Prince leave you fixed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I have something beside the money you
saw me counting,&#8221; she told him, bluntly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And Willets Starkweather doesn&#8217;t know it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has never asked me if I were in
funds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I bet you!&#8221; cackled Grimes, at last giving
way to a spasm of mirth which, Helen thought,
was not nice to look upon. &#8220;And how does he
fancy having you in his family?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He does not like it. Neither do his daughters.
And one of their reasons is because people
will ask questions about Prince Morrell&#8217;s daughter.
They are afraid their friends will bring up
father&#8217;s old trouble,&#8221; continued Helen, her voice
quivering. &#8220;So that is why, Mr. Grime&#8217;s, I am
determined to know the truth about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The truth? What do you mean?&#8221; snarled
Grimes, suddenly starting out of his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, sir,&#8221; said Helen, amazed, &#8220;dad told
me all about it when he was dying. All he knew.
But he said by this time surely the truth of the matter
must have come to light. I want to clear his
name&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How are you going to do <i>that</i>?&#8221; demanded
Mr. Grimes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you will help me&mdash;if you can, sir,&#8221;
she said, pleadingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I help more now than I could at
the time he was charged with the crime?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know. Perhaps you can&#8217;t. Perhaps
Uncle Starkweather cannot, either. But, it seems
to me, if anything had been heard from that bookkeeper&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Allen Chesterton?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! I don&#8217;t know how you are going to
prove it, but I have always believed Allen was
guilty,&#8221; declared Mr. Grimes, nodding his head
vigorously, and still watching her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, have you, Mr. Grimes?&#8221; cried the girl,
eagerly, clasping her hands. &#8220;You have <i>always</i>
believed it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so. Evidence was against my old partner&mdash;yes.
But it wasn&#8217;t very direct. And then&mdash;what
became of Allen? Why did he run away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what other people said about father,&#8221;
said Helen, doubtfully. &#8220;It did not make him
guilty, but it made him <i>look</i> guilty. The same
can be said of the bookkeeper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how can you go farther than that?&#8221;
asked Mr. Grimes. &#8220;It&#8217;s too long ago for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
facts to be brought out. We can have our suspicions.
We might even publish our suspicions.
Let us get something in the papers&mdash;I can do it,&#8221;
and he nodded, decisively, &#8220;stating that facts recently
brought to light seemed to prove conclusively
that Prince Morrell, once accused of embezzlement
of the bank accounts of the firm of
Grimes &amp; Morrell, was guiltless of that crime.
And we will state that the surviving partner of the
firm is convinced that the only person guilty of that
embezzlement was one Allen Chesterton, who was
the firm&#8217;s bookkeeper. How about <i>that</i>? Wouldn&#8217;t
that fill the bill?&#8221; asked Mr. Grimes, rubbing
his hands together.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we had such an article published in the
papers and circulated among his old friends,
wouldn&#8217;t that satisfy you, my dear? Then you
would do no more of this foolish probing for facts
that cannot possibly be reached&mdash;eh? What do
you say, Helen Morrell? Isn&#8217;t that a famous
idea?&#8221;</p>
<p>But the girl from Sunset Ranch was, for the
moment, speechless. For a second time, it seemed
to her, she was being bribed to make no serious
investigation of the evidence connected with her
father&#8217;s old trouble. Both Uncle Starkweather
and this old man seemed to desire to head her
off!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>&#8220;JONES&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that a famous idea?&#8221; demanded Mr.
Grimes, for the second time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I am not so sure, sir,&#8221; Helen stammered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course it is!&#8221; he cried, smiting the
desk before him with the flat of his palm. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you see that your father&#8217;s name will be cleared of
all doubt? And quite right, too! He never <i>was</i>
guilty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes me quite happy to hear you say so,&#8221;
said the girl, wiping her eyes. &#8220;But how about
the bookkeeper?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&mdash;Allen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we couldn&#8217;t find him now. If he kept hidden
then, when there was a hue and cry out for him,
what chance would there be of finding him after
seventeen years? Oh, no! Allen can&#8217;t be found.
And, even if he could, I doubt but the thing is
outlawed. I don&#8217;t know that the authorities would
take it up. And I am pretty sure the creditors of
the old firm would not.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That is not what I mean,&#8221; said Helen, softly.
&#8220;But suppose we accuse this bookkeeper&mdash;<i>and he
is not guilty, either</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! Is that any great odds? Nobody
knows where he is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But suppose he should reappear,&#8221; persisted
Helen. &#8220;Suppose somebody who loved him&mdash;a
daughter, perhaps, as I am the daughter of Prince
Morrell&mdash;with just as great a desire to clear her
father&#8217;s name as I have to clear mine&mdash;&mdash; Suppose
such a person should appear determined to
prove Mr. Chesterton not guilty, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha, but we&#8217;ve beat &#8217;em to it&mdash;don&#8217;t you see?&#8221;
demanded Mr. Grimes, heartlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sir! I could not take such an apparent
victory at such a cost!&#8221; cried Helen, wiping her
eyes again. &#8220;You say you <i>believe</i> Allen Chesterton
was guilty instead of father. But you put forward
no evidence&mdash;no more than the mere suspicion
that cursed poor dad. No, no, sir! To
claim new evidence, but to show no new evidence,
is not enough. I must find out for sure just who
stole that money. That is what dad himself said
would be the only way in which his name could be
cleared.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense, girl!&#8221; ejaculated Fenwick Grimes,
scowling again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry to go against both your wishes and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
Uncle Starkweather&#8217;s,&#8221; said Helen, slowly. &#8220;But
I want the truth! I can&#8217;t be satisfied with anything
but the truth about this whole unfortunate business.</p>
<p>&#8220;It made poor dad very unhappy when he was
dying. It troubled my poor mother&mdash;so <i>he</i> said&mdash;all
her life out there in Montana. I want to know
where the money went&mdash;who got it&mdash;all about it.
Then I can prove to people that it was not <i>my</i>
father who committed the crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a very quixotic thing you have undertaken,
my girl,&#8221; remarked Mr. Grimes, with a sudden
change in his manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope not. I hope I shall learn the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
<p>He shot the question at her as from a gun. His
face had grown very grim and his sly little eyes
gleamed threateningly. More than ever did Helen
dislike and fear this man. The avaricious light in
his eyes as he noted the money she carried on the
train, had first warned her against him. Now,
when she knew so much more about him, and how
he was immediately connected with her father&#8217;s old
trouble, Helen feared him all the more.</p>
<p>Because of his love of money alone, she could
not trust him. And he had suggested something
which was, upon the face of it, dishonest and unfair.
She rose from her seat and shook her head slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know how,&#8221; Helen said, sadly. &#8220;But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
I hope something may turn up to help me. I
understand that you have never known anything
about Allen Chesterton since he ran away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a thing,&#8221; declared Mr. Grimes, shortly,
rising as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is through him I hoped to find the truth,&#8221;
she murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you won&#8217;t accept my help?&#8221; growled Mr.
Grimes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not&mdash;not the kind you offer. It&mdash;it wouldn&#8217;t
be right,&#8221; Helen replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, then!&#8221; snapped the man, and
opened the door into the outer office. As he
ushered her into the other room the outer door
opened and a shabby man poked his head and
shoulders in at the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say!&#8221; he said, quaveringly. &#8220;Is Mr.
Grimes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out of here, you old ruffian!&#8221; cried Fenwick
Grimes, flying into a sudden passion. &#8220;Of
course, you&#8217;d got to come around to-day!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I only wanted to say, Mr. Grimes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of my sight!&#8221; roared Grimes. &#8220;Here,
Leggett!&#8221; to his clerk; &#8220;give Jones a dollar and
let him go. I can&#8217;t see him now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jones, sir?&#8221; queried the clerk, seemingly
somewhat staggered, and looking from his employer
to the old scarecrow in the doorway.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir!&#8221; snarled Mr. Grimes. &#8220;I said
Jones, sir&mdash;Jones, Jones, Jones! Do you understand
plain English, Mr. Leggett? Take that dollar
on the desk and give it into the hands of
<i>Jones</i> there at the door. And then oblige me by
kicking him down the steps if he doesn&#8217;t move fast
enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leggett moved rapidly himself after this. He
seemed to catch his employer&#8217;s real meaning, and
he grabbed the dollar and chased the beggar out
into the hall. Grimes, meanwhile, held Helen
back a bit. But he had nothing of any consequence
to say.</p>
<p>Finally she bade him good-morning and went
out of the office. She had not given him Uncle
Starkweather&#8217;s letter. Somehow, she thought it
best not to do so. If she had been doubtful of the
sincerity of her uncle when she broached the subject
nearest her heart, she had been much more
suspicious of Fenwick Grimes.</p>
<p>She walked composedly enough out of the building;
but it was hard work to keep back the tears.
It <i>did</i> seem such a great task for a mere girl to
attempt! And nobody would help her. She had
nobody in whom to confide&mdash;nobody with whom
she might discuss the mystery.</p>
<p>And when she told herself this her mind naturally
flashed to the only real friend she had made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
in New York&mdash;Sadie Goronsky. Helen had
looked up a map of the city the evening before in
her uncle&#8217;s library, and she had marked the streets
intervening between this place where she had interviewed
her father&#8217;s old partner, and Madison
Street on the East Side.</p>
<p>She had ridden downtown to Washington Arch;
so she felt equal to the walk across town and down
the Bowery to the busy street where Sadie plied
her peculiar trade.</p>
<p>She crossed the Square and went through West
Broadway to Bleecker Street and turned east on
that busy and interesting thoroughfare. Suddenly,
right ahead of her, she beheld the shabby brown
hat and wrinkled coat of the old man who had
stuck his head in at the door of Mr. Grimes&#8217;s
office, and so disturbed the equilibrium of that individual.</p>
<p>Here was &#8220;Jones.&#8221; At first Helen thought him
to be under the influence of drink. Then she saw
that the man&#8217;s erratic actions must be the result of
some physical or mental disability.</p>
<p>The old man could not walk in a straight line;
but he tacked from one side of the walk to the
other, taking long &#8220;slants&#8221; across the walk, first
touching the iron balustrade of a step on one hand,
and then bringing up at a post on the edge of the
curb.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>He seemed to mutter all the time to himself,
too; but what he said, or whether it was sense, or
nonsense, Helen (although she walked near him)
could not make out. She did not wish to offend
the old man; yet he seemed so helpless and peculiar
that for several blocks she trailed him (as
he seemed to be going her way), fearing that he
would get into some trouble.</p>
<p>At the busy crossings Helen was really worried.
The man first started, then dodged back, scouted
up and down the way, seemed undecided, looked
all around as though for help, and then, at the
very worst time, when the vehicles in the street
were the most numerous, he darted across, escaping
death and destruction half a dozen times between
curb and curb.</p>
<p>But somehow the angel that directs the destinies
of foolish people who cross busy city streets,
shielded him from harm, and Helen finally lost
him as he turned down one of the main stems of
the town while she kept on into the heart of
the East Side.</p>
<p>And to Helen Morrell, the very &#8220;heart of the
East Side&#8221; was right in the Goronsky flat on
Madison Street. She had been comparing that
home at the same number on Madison Street with
that her uncle&#8217;s house boasted on Madison Avenue,
with the latter mansion. The Goronsky tenement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
was a <i>home</i>, for love and contentment dwelt there;
the stately Starkweather dwelling housed too many
warring factions to be a real home.</p>
<p>Helen came, at length, to Madison Street. She
had timed her coming so as to reach Jacob Finkelstein&#8217;s
shop just about the time Sadie would be
going to dinner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Helen! Ain&#8217;t I glad to see you?&#8221; cried
Sadie. &#8220;Is there anything the matter with the
dress, yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Miss Sadie. I was downtown and
thought I would ask you to go to dinner with me.
I went with you yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O-oo my! I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Sadie, shaking
her head. &#8220;I bet you&#8217;d like to come home
with me instead&mdash;no?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to. But it would not be right
for me to accept your hospitality and never return
it,&#8221; said Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chee! you must &#8217;a&#8217; had a legacy,&#8221; laughed
Sadie.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I have a little more money than I had yesterday,&#8221;
admitted Helen, which was true, for she
had taken some out of the wallet in the trunk before
she left her uncle&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, when you swells feel like spendin&#8217; there
ain&#8217;t no stoppin&#8217; youse, I suppose,&#8221; declared Sadie.
&#8220;Do you wanter fly real high?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we can afford a real nice dinner,&#8221; said
Helen, smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you good for as high as thirty-fi&#8217; cents
apiece?&#8221; demanded Sadie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chee! Then I can take you to a stylish place
where we can get a swell feed at noon, for that.
It&#8217;s up on Grand Street. All the buyers and department
store heads go there with the wholesale
salesmen for lunch. Wait till I git me hat!&#8221; and
away Sadie shot, up the tenement house stairs, so
fast that her little feet, bound by the tight skirt
she wore, seemed fairly to twinkle.</p>
<p>Helen had but a few moments to wait on the
sidewalk; yet within that short time something
happened to change the entire current of the day&#8217;s
adventures. She heard some boys shouting from
the direction of the Bowery; there was a crowd
crossing the street diagonally; she watched it with
some apprehension at first, for it came right along
the sidewalk toward her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, fellers! See de Lurcher! Here comes de
Lurcher!&#8221; yelled one ribald youth, who leaped on
the stoop to which Helen had retreated the better
to see over the heads of the crowd at the person
who was the core of it.</p>
<p>And then Helen, in no little amazement, saw
that this individual was none other than the man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
whom she had seen driven out of Fenwick Grimes&#8217;s
office. A gang of hoodlums surrounded him.
They jeered at him, tore at his ragged clothes,
hooted, and otherwise nagged the poor old fellow.</p>
<p>At every halt he made they pressed closer upon
the &#8220;Lurcher.&#8221; It was easy to see why he had
been given that name. He was probably an old
inhabitant of the neighborhood, and his lurching
from side to side of the walk had suggested the
nickname to some local wit.</p>
<p>Just as he steered for the rail of the step on
which Helen stood, half fearful, and reached it,
Sadie Goronsky came bounding out of the house.
Instantly she took a hand&mdash;and as usual a master
hand&mdash;in the affair.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you doin&#8217; to that old man, you Izzy
Strefonifsky? And, Freddie Bloom, you stop or
I&#8217;ll tell your mommer! Ike, let him alone, or I&#8217;ll
make your ears tingle myself&mdash;I can do it,
too!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sadie charged as she commanded. The hoodlums
scattered&mdash;some laughing, some not so easily
intimidated. But the old man was clinging to the
rail and muttering over and over to himself:</p>
<p>&#8220;They got my dollar&mdash;they got my dollar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; cried Sadie, coming back after
chasing the last of the boys off the block.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Mr. Lurcher?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My dollar&mdash;they got my dollar,&#8221; muttered the
old man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; whispered Helen. &#8220;And perhaps
it was all he had.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can bet it was,&#8221; said Sadie, angrily.
&#8220;The likes of him wouldn&#8217;t likely have <i>two</i> dollars
all at once! I&#8217;d like to scalp those imps!
That I would!&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man, paying little attention to the two
girls, but still muttering about his loss, lurched
away on his erratic course homeward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chee!&#8221; said Sadie. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t that tough luck?
He lives right around the corner, all alone. And
he&#8217;s just as poor as he can be. I don&#8217;t know what
his real name is. But the boys guy him sumpin&#8217;
fierce! Ain&#8217;t it mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly is,&#8221; agreed Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say!&#8221; said Sadie, abruptly, but looking at
Helen with sheepish eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, was yer <i>honest</i> goin&#8217; to blow seventy cents
for that feed I spoke of up on Grand Street?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. And I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And a dime to the waiter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s eighty cents,&#8221; ran on Sadie, glibly
enough now. &#8220;And twenty would make a dollar.
I&#8217;ll dig up the twenty cents to put with your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
eighty, and what d&#8217;ye say we run after old Lurcher
an&#8217; give him a dollar&mdash;say we found it, you know&mdash;and
then go upstairs to my house for dinner?
Mommer&#8217;s got a nice dinner, and she&#8217;d like to see
you again fine!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it!&#8221; cried Helen, pulling out her purse
at once. &#8220;Here! Here&#8217;s a dollar bill. You run
after him and give it to him. You can give me
the twenty cents later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; cried the Russian girl, and she was
off around the corner in the wake of the Lurcher,
with flying feet.</p>
<p>Helen waited for her friend to return, just inside
the tenement house door. When Sadie reappeared,
Helen hugged her tight and kissed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a <i>dear</i>!&#8221; the Western girl cried. &#8220;I
do love you, Sadie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, chee! That ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217;,&#8221; objected the
East Side girl. &#8220;We poor folks has gotter help
each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Helen would not spoil the little sacrifice by
acknowledging to more money, and they climbed
the stairs again to the Goronsky tenement. The
girl from Sunset Ranch was glad&mdash;oh, so glad!&mdash;of
this incident. Chilled as she had been by the
selfishness in her uncle&#8217;s Madison Avenue mansion,
she was glad to have her heart warmed down here
among the poor of Madison Street.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>OUT OF STEP WITH THE TIMES</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Sadie told Helen, afterward, &#8220;I am
very sure that poor Lurcher man doesn&#8217;t drink.
Some says he does; but you never notice it on him.
It&#8217;s just his eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His eyes?&#8221; queried Helen, wonderingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He&#8217;s sort of blind. His eyelids keep
fluttering all the time. He can&#8217;t control them.
And, if you notice, he usually lifts up the lid of one
eye with his finger before he makes one of his
base-runs for the next post. Chee! I&#8217;d hate to be
like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The poor old man! And can nothing be done
for it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Plenty, I reckon. But who&#8217;s goin&#8217; to pay for
it? Not him&mdash;he ain&#8217;t got it to pay. We all has
our troubles down here, Helen.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls had come down from the home of
Sadie again, and Helen was preparing to leave
her friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t there places to go in the city to have
one&#8217;s eyes examined? Free hospitals, I mean?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sure! And they got Lurcher to one, once.
But all they give him was a prescription for glasses,
and it would cost a lot to get &#8217;em. So it didn&#8217;t do
him no good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen looked at Sadie suddenly. &#8220;How much
would it take for the glasses?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I dunno. Ten dollars, mebbe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And do you s&#8217;pose he could have that prescription
now?&#8221; asked Helen, eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe. But why for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I could&mdash;could get somebody uptown
interested in his case who is able to pay for the
spectacles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chee, that would be bully!&#8221; cried Sadie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you find out about the prescription?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure I will,&#8221; declared Sadie. &#8220;Nex&#8217; time you
come down here, Helen, I&#8217;ll know all about it.
And if you can get one of them rich ladies up there
to pay for &#8217;em&mdash;Well! it would beat goin&#8217; to a
swell restaurant for a feed&mdash;eh?&#8221; and she laughed,
hugged the Western girl, and then darted across
the sidewalk to intercept a possible customer who
was loitering past the row of garments displayed
in front of the Finkelstein shop.</p>
<p>But Helen did not get downtown again as soon
as she expected. When she awoke the next morning
there had set in a steady drizzle&mdash;cold and
raw&mdash;and the panes of her windows were so murky
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
that she could not see even the chimneys and roofs,
or down into the barren little yards.</p>
<p>This&mdash;nor a much heavier&mdash;rain would not
have ordinarily balked Helen. She was used to
being out in all winds and weathers. But she
actually had nothing fit to wear in the rain.</p>
<p>If she had worn the new cheap dress out of
doors she knew what would happen. It would
shrink all out of shape. And she had no raincoat,
nor would she ask her cousins&mdash;so she told
herself&mdash;for the loan of an umbrella.</p>
<p>So, as long as it rained steadily, it looked as
though the girl from Sunset Ranch was a sure-enough
&#8220;shut-in.&#8221; Nor did she contemplate this
possibility with any pleasure.</p>
<p>There was nothing for her to do but read.
And one cannot read all the time. She had no
&#8220;fancy-work&#8221; with which to keep her hands and
mind busy. She wondered what her cousins did on
such days. She found out by keeping her ears
and eyes open. After breakfast Belle went shopping
in the limousine. There was an early
luncheon and all three of the Starkweather girls
went to a matinée. In neither case was Helen
invited to go&mdash;no, indeed! She was treated as
though she were not even in the house. Seldom
did either of the older girls speak to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might as well be a ghost,&#8221; thought Helen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>And this reminded her of the little old lady who
paced the ghost-walk every night&mdash;the ex-nurse,
Mary Boyle. She had thought of going to see her
on the top floor before; but she had not been able
to pluck up the courage.</p>
<p>Now that her cousins were gone from the house,
however, and Mrs. Olstrom was taking a nap
in her room, and Mr. Lawdor was out of the way,
and all the under-servants mildly celebrating the
free afternoon below stairs, Helen determined to
venture out of her own room, along the main passage
of the top floor, to the door which she believed
must give upon the front suite of rooms
which the little old lady occupied.</p>
<p>She knocked, but there was no response. Nor
could she hear any sound from within. It struck
Helen that the principal cruelty of the Starkweathers&#8217;
treatment of this old soul was her being
shut away alone up here at the top of the house&mdash;too
far away from the rest of its occupants for a
cry to be heard if the old lady should be in trouble.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they shut up a dog like this, he would howl
and thus attract attention to his state,&#8221; muttered
Helen. &#8220;But here is a human being&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She tried the door. The latch clicked and the
door swung open. Helen stepped into a narrow,
hall-like room, well furnished with old-fashioned
furniture (probably brought from below stairs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
when Mr. Starkweather re-decorated the mansion)
with one window in it. The door which
evidently gave upon the remainder of the suite
was closed.</p>
<p>As Helen listened, however, from behind this
closed door came a cheerful, cracked voice&mdash;the
same voice she had heard whispering the lullaby in
the middle of the night. But now it was tuning
up on an old-time ballad, very popular in its day:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;Wait till the clouds roll by, Jennie&mdash;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Wait till the clouds roll by!</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Jennie, my own true loved one&mdash;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Wait till the clouds roll by.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t sound like a hopeless prisoner,&#8221;
thought Helen, with surprise.</p>
<p>She waited a minute longer and, as the thin yet
still sweet voice stopped, Helen knocked timidly
on the inner door. Immediately the voice said,
&#8220;Come in, deary. &#8217;Tis not for the likes of you to
be knockin&#8217; at old Mary&#8217;s door. Come in!&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen turned the knob slowly and went into the
room. The moment she crossed the threshold she
forgot the clouds and rain and gloominess which
had depressed her. Indeed, it seemed as though
the sun must be ever shining into this room, high
up under the roof of the Starkweather mansion.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>In the first place, it was most cheerfully papered
and painted. There were pretty, simple, yellow
and white hangings. The heavier pieces of old
furniture had gay &#8220;tidies&#8221; or &#8220;throws&#8221; upon
them to relieve the sombreness of the dark wood.
The pictures on the walls were all in white or gold
frames, and were of a cheerful nature&mdash;mostly
pictures of childhood, or pictures which would
amuse children. Evidently much of the furnishings
of the old nursery had been brought up here
to Mary Boyle&#8217;s sitting-room.</p>
<p>Helen had a glimpse, through a half-open door,
of the bedroom&mdash;quite as bright and pretty.
There was a little stove set up here, and a fire
burned in it. It was one of those stoves that have
isinglass all around it so that the fire can be seen
when it burns red. It added mightily to the cheerful
tone of the room.</p>
<p>How neat everything appeared! Yet the very
neatest thing in sight was the little old lady herself,
sitting in a green-painted rocker, with a low
sewing-table at her side, wooden needles clicking
fast in her fleecy knitting.</p>
<p>She looked up at Helen with a little, bird-like
motion&mdash;her head a bit on one side and her glance
quizzical. This, it proved, was typical of Mary
Boyle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Deary, deary me!&#8221; she said. &#8220;You&#8217;re a <i>new</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
girl. And what do you want Mary to do for
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I thought I&#8217;d come and make you a little
call,&#8221; said Helen, timidly.</p>
<p>This wasn&#8217;t at all as she expected to find the
shut-in! Instead of gloom, and tears, and the
weakness of age, here were displayed all the opposite
emotions and qualities. The woman who was
forgotten did not appear to be an object of pity
at all. She merely seemed out of step with the
times.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re very welcome, deary,&#8221; said
the old nurse. &#8220;Draw up the little rocker yonder.
I always keep it for young company,&#8221; and
Mary Boyle, who had had no young company up
here for ten or a dozen years, spoke as though the
appearance of a youthful face and form was of
daily occurrence.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; spoke Helen, more confidently, &#8220;we
are neighbors on this top floor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neighbors; air we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I live up here, too. The family have tucked
me away out of sight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; said the little old woman. &#8220;We
shouldn&#8217;t criticise our bethers. No, no! And
this is a very cheerful par-r-rt of the house, so
it is.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But it must be awful,&#8221; exclaimed Helen, &#8220;to
have to stay in it all the time!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have to stay in it all the time,&#8221; replied
the nurse, quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am. I hear you in the night going
downstairs and walking in the corridor,&#8221; Helen
said, softly.</p>
<p>The wrinkled old face blushed very prettily, and
Mary Boyle looked at her visitor doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, &#8217;tis such a comfort for an old body like
me,&#8221; she said, at last, &#8220;to make believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Make believe?&#8221; cried Helen, with a smile.
&#8220;Why, <i>I&#8217;m</i> not old, and I love to make believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yis! But there is a differ bechune the
make-believes of the young and the make-believes
of the old. <i>You</i> are playin&#8217; you&#8217;re grown up,
or dramin&#8217; of what&#8217;s comin&#8217; to you in th&#8217; future&mdash;sure,
I know! I&#8217;ve had them drames, too, in me
day.</p>
<p>&#8220;But with old folks &#8217;tis different. We do be
har-r-rking back instead of lookin&#8217; for&#8217;ard. And
with me, it&#8217;s thinkin&#8217; of the babies I&#8217;ve held in me
ar-r-rms, and rocked on me knee, and walked the
flure wid when they was ailin&#8217;&mdash;An&#8217; sure the
babies of <i>this</i> house was always ailin&#8217;, poor little
things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They were a great trouble to you, then?&#8221;
asked Helen, softly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Trouble, is it?&#8221; cried Mary Boyle, her eyes
shining again. &#8220;Sure, how could a blessid infant
be a trouble? &#8217;Tis a means of grace they be to the
hear-r-rt&mdash;I nade no preacher to tell me that,
deary. I found thim so. And they loved me and
was happy wid me,&#8221; she added, cheerfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;The folks below think me a little quare in me
head,&#8221; she confided to her visitor. &#8220;But they
don&#8217;t understand. To walk up and down the nursery
corridor late at night relaves the ache here,&#8221;
and she put her little, mitted hand upon her
heart. &#8220;Ye see, I trod that path so often&mdash;so
often&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Her voice trailed off and she fell silent, gazing
into the glow of the fire in the stove. But there
was a smile on her lips. The past was no time to
weep over. This cheerful body saw only the
bright spots in her long, long life.</p>
<p>Helen loved to hear her talk. And soon she and
Mary Boyle were very well acquainted. One thing
about the old nurse Helen liked immensely. She
asked no questions. She accepted Helen&#8217;s visit
as a matter of course; yet she showed very plainly
that she was glad to have a young face before
her.</p>
<p>But the girl from Sunset Ranch did not know
how Mrs. Olstrom might view her making friends
with the old lady; so she made her visit brief. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
she promised to come again and bring a book to
read to Mary Boyle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Radin&#8217; is a great accomplishment, deary,&#8221;
declared the old woman. &#8220;I niver seemed able to
masther it&mdash;although me mistress oft tried to tache
me. But, sure, there was so much to l&#8217;arn about
babies, that ain&#8217;t printed in no book, that I was
always radin&#8217; them an&#8217; niver missed the book
eddication till I come to be old. But th&#8217; foine
poethry me mistress useter be radin&#8217; me! Sure,
&#8217;twould almost put a body to slape, so swate and
grand it was.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, Helen searched out a book of poems downstairs,
and the next forenoon she ventured into the
front suite again, and read ta Mary Boyle for an
hour. The storm lasted several days, and each day
the girl from the West spent more and more time
with the little old woman.</p>
<p>But this was all unsuspected by Uncle Starkweather
and the three girls. If Mrs. Olstrom
knew she said nothing. At least, she timed her
own daily visits to the little old woman so that she
would not meet Helen in the rooms devoted to
old Mary&#8217;s comfort.</p>
<p>Nor were Helen&#8217;s visits continued solely because
she pitied Mary Boyle. How could she
continue to pity one who did not pity herself?</p>
<p>No. Helen received more than she gave in this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
strange friendship. Seeking to amuse the old
nurse, she herself gained such an uplift of heart
and mind that it began to counteract that spirit
of sullenness that had entered into the Western
girl when she had first come to this house and
had been received so unkindly by her relatives.</p>
<p>Instead of hating them, she began to pity them.
How much Uncle Starkweather was missing by
being so utterly selfish! How much the girls were
missing by being self-centred!</p>
<p>Why, see it right here in Mary Boyle&#8217;s case!
Nobody could associate with the delightful little
old woman without gaining good from the association.
Instead of being friends with the old nurse,
and loving her and being loved by her, the Starkweather
girls tucked her away in the attic and
tried to ignore her existence.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re missing&mdash;poor
things!&#8221; murmured Helen, thinking the situation
over.</p>
<p>And from that time her own attitude changed
toward her cousins. She began to look out for
chances to help them, instead of making herself
more and more objectionable to Belle, Hortense,
and Flossie.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>BREAKING THE ICE</h3>
</div>

<p>As for Floss, Helen had already got a hold
upon that young lady.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Helen!&#8221; the younger cousin would
whisper after dinner. &#8220;Come up to my room and
give me a start on these lessons; will you? That&#8217;s
a good chap.&#8221;</p>
<p>And often when the rest of the family thought
the unwelcome visitor had retired to her room at
the top of the house, she was shut in with Flossie,
trying to guide the stumbling feet of that rather
dull girl over the hard places in her various
studies.</p>
<p>For Floss had soon discovered that the girl
from Sunset Ranch somehow had a wonderful
insight into every problem she put up to her. Nor
were they all in algebra.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you managed to do it, &#8217;way out
there in that wild place you lived in; but you must
have gone through &#8217;most all the text-books I have,&#8221;
declared Flossie, once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I had to grab every chance there was for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
schooling,&#8221; Helen responded, and changed the
subject instantly.</p>
<p>Flossie thought she had a secret from her sisters,
however, and she hugged it to her with much glee.
She realized that Helen was by no means the
ignoramus Belle and Hortense said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And let &#8217;em keep on thinking it,&#8221; Flossie said,
to herself, with a chuckle. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what
Helen has got up her sleeve; but I believe she is
fooling all of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>A long, dreary fortnight of inclement weather
finally got on the nerves of Hortense. Belle could
go out tramping in it, or cab-riding, or what-not.
She was athletic, and loved exercise in the open
air, no matter what the weather might be. But
the second sister was just like a pussy-cat; she loved
comfort and the warm corners. However, being
left alone by Belle, and nobody coming in to call
for several days, Hortense was completely overpowered
by loneliness.</p>
<p>She had nothing within herself to fight off nervousness
and depression. So, having caught a little,
sniffly cold, she decided that she was sick and went
to bed.</p>
<p>The Starkweather girls did not each have a
maid. Mr. Starkweather could not afford that
luxury. But Hortense at once requisitioned one
of the housemaids to wait upon her and of course
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
Mrs. Olstrom&#8217;s very carefully-thought-out system
was immediately turned topsy-turvy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot allow you, Miss, to have the services
of Maggie all day long,&#8221; Helen heard the housekeeper
announce at the door of the invalid&#8217;s room.
&#8220;We are not prepared to do double work in this
house. You must either speak to your father and
have a nurse brought in, or wait upon yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you heartless, wicked thing!&#8221; cried Hortense.
&#8220;How can you be so cruel? I couldn&#8217;t
wait upon myself. I want my broth. And I
want my hair done. And you can see yourself
how the room is all in a mess. And&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maggie must do her parlor work to-day. You
know that. If you want to be waited upon, Miss,
get your sister to do it,&#8221; concluded the housekeeper,
and marched away.</p>
<p>&#8220;And she very well knows that Belle has gone
out somewhere and Flossie is at school. I could
<i>die</i> here, and nobody would care,&#8221; wailed Hortense.</p>
<p>Helen walked into the richly furnished room.
Hortense was crying into her pillow. Her hair
was still in two unkempt braids and she <i>did</i> need
a fresh boudoir cap and gown.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I do anything to help you, &#8217;Tense?&#8221; asked
Helen, cheerfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear me&mdash;no!&#8221; exclaimed her cousin.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
&#8220;You&#8217;re so loud and noisy. And do, <i>do</i> call me
by my proper name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I forgot. Sure, I&#8217;ll call you anything you
say,&#8221; returned the Western girl, smiling at her.
Meanwhile she was moving about the room,
deftly putting things to rights.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to tell father the minute he comes
home!&#8221; wailed Hortense, ignoring her cousin for
the time and going back to her immediate troubles.
&#8220;I am left all alone&mdash;and I&#8217;m sick&mdash;and
nobody cares&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you keep your caps, Hortense?&#8221; interrupted
Helen. &#8220;And if you&#8217;ll let me, I&#8217;ll brush
your hair and make it look pretty. And then you
get into a fresh nightgown&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I couldn&#8217;t sit up,&#8221; moaned Hortense. &#8220;I
really couldn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m too weak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you how. Let me fix the pillows&mdash;<i>so!</i>
And <i>so!</i> There&mdash;nothing like trying; is
there? You&#8217;re comfortable; aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We-ell&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen was already manipulating the hairbrush.
She did it so well, and managed to arrange Hortense&#8217;s
really beautiful hair so simply yet easily on
her head that the latter quite approved of it&mdash;and
said so&mdash;when she looked into her hand-mirror.</p>
<p>Then Helen got her into a chair, in a fresh
robe and a pretty kimono, while she made the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
bed&mdash;putting on new sheets and cases for the pillows
so that all should be sweet and clean. Of
course, Hortense wasn&#8217;t really sick&mdash;only lazy.
But she thought she was sick and Helen&#8217;s attentions
pleased the spoiled girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you&#8217;re not such a bad little thing,
Helen,&#8221; she said, dipping into a box of chocolates
on the stand by her bedside. Chocolates were
about all the medicine Hortense took during this
&#8220;bad attack.&#8221; And she was really grateful&mdash;in
her way&mdash;to her cousin.</p>
<p>It was later on this day that Helen plucked up
courage to go to her uncle and give him back the
letter he had written to Fenwick Grimes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not use it, sir,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahem!&#8221; he said, and with evident relief.
&#8220;You have thought better of it, I hope? You
mean to let the matter rest where it is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not abandoned my attempt to get at
the truth&mdash;no, Uncle Starkweather.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How foolish of you, child!&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not think it is foolish. But I will try not
to mix you up in my inquiries. That is why I did
not use the letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you have seen Grimes?&#8221; he asked,
hastily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he know who you are?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you reached him without an introduction?
I understand he is hard to approach. He
is a money-lender, in a way, and he has an odd
manner of never appearing to come into personal
contact with his clients.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. I think him odd.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did&mdash;did he think he could help you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He thinks just as you do, sir,&#8221; stated Helen,
honestly. &#8220;And, then, he accused you of sending
me to him at first; so I would not use your letter
and so compromise you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahem!&#8221; said the gentleman, surprised that
this young girl should be so circumspect. It rather
startled him to discover that she was thoughtful
far beyond her years. Was it possible that&mdash;somehow&mdash;she
<i>might</i> bring to light the truth regarding
the unhappy difficulty that had made Prince Morrell
an exile from his old home for so many
years?</p>
<p>Once May Van Ramsden ran in to see Belle and
caught Helen going through the hall on her way
to her own room. It was just after luncheon,
which she and Belle had eaten in a silence that
could be felt. Belle would not speak to her cousin
unless she was obliged to, and Helen did not see
that forcing her attentions upon the other girl
would do any good.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, here you are, Helen Morrell! Why
don&#8217;t I ever see you when I come here?&#8221; cried the
caller, shaking Helen by both hands and smiling
upon her heartily from her superior height.
&#8220;When are your cousins going to bring you to
call upon me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen might have replied, truthfully, &#8220;Never;&#8221;
but she only shook her head and smilingly declared:
&#8220;I hope to see you again soon, Miss Van
Ramsden.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess you must!&#8221; cried the caller.
&#8220;I want to hear some more of your experiences,&#8221;
and she went on to meet the scowling Belle at the
door of the reception parlor.</p>
<p>Later her eldest cousin said to the Western girl:</p>
<p>&#8220;In going up and down to your room, Miss, I
want you to remember that there is a back stairway.
Use the servants&#8217; stairs, if you please!&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen made no reply. She wasn&#8217;t breaking
much of the ice between her and Belle Starkweather,
that was sure. And to add to Belle&#8217;s
dislike for her cousin, there was another happening
in which Miss Van Ramsden was concerned,
soon after this.</p>
<p>Hortense was still abed, for the weather remained
unpleasant&mdash;and there really was nothing
else for the languid cousin to do. Miss Van Ramsden
found Belle out, and she went upstairs to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
say &#8220;how-do&#8221; to the invalid. Helen was in the
room making the spoiled girl more comfortable,
and Miss Van Ramsden drew the younger girl
out into the hall when she left.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really have come to see <i>you</i>, child,&#8221; she said
to Helen, frankly. &#8220;I was telling papa about
you and he said he would dearly love to meet
Prince Morrell&#8217;s daughter. Papa went to college
with your father, my dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen was glad of this, and yet she flushed a
little. She was quite frank, however: &#8220;Does&mdash;does
your father know about poor dad&#8217;s trouble?&#8221;
she whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;He does. And he always believed Mr. Morrell
not guilty. Father was one of the firm&#8217;s
creditors, and he has always wished your father
had come to him instead of leaving the city so
long ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he&#8217;s been paid?&#8221; cried Helen, eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. It is a secret, I believe&mdash;father
warned me not to speak of it unless you did; but
everybody was paid by your father after a time.
<i>That</i> did not look as though he were dishonest.
His partner took advantage of the bankruptcy
courts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of&mdash;of course your father has no idea who
<i>was</i> guilty?&#8221; whispered Helen, anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;None at all,&#8221; replied Miss Van Ramsden.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
&#8220;It was a mystery then and remains so to this
day. That bookkeeper was a peculiar man, but
had a good record; and it seems that he left the
city before the checks were cashed. Or, so the
evidence seemed to prove.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t cry, my dear! Come! I wish
we could help you clear up that old trouble. But
many of your father&#8217;s old friends&mdash;like papa&mdash;never
believed Prince Morrell guilty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen was crying by this time. The kindness
of this older girl broke down her self-possession.
They heard somebody coming up the stairs, and
Miss Van Ramsden said, quickly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Take me to your room, dear. We can talk
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen never thought that she might be giving
the Starkweather family deadly offence by doing
this. She led Miss Van Ramsden immediately to
the rear of the house and up the back stairway to
the attic floor. The caller looked somewhat
amazed when Helen ushered her into the
room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they could not have put you much nearer
the sky; could they?&#8221; she said, laughing, yet eyeing
Helen askance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mind it up here,&#8221; returned Helen,
truthfully enough. &#8220;And I have some company
on this floor.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ahem! The maids, I suppose?&#8221; said May
Van Ramsden.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; Helen assured her, eagerly. &#8220;The
dearest little old lady you ever saw.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she stopped and looked at her caller in
some distress. For the moment she had forgotten
that she was probably on the way to reveal the
Starkweather family skeleton!</p>
<p>&#8220;A little old lady? Who can <i>that</i> be?&#8221; cried
the caller. &#8220;You interest me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;Well, it is an old lady who was once
nurse in the family and I believe Uncle Starkweather
cares for her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s never Nurse Boyle?&#8221; cried Miss Van
Ramsden, suddenly starting up. &#8220;Why! I remember
about her. But somehow, I thought she
had died years ago. Why, as a child I used to
visit her at the house, and she used to like to have
me come to see her. That was before your cousins
lived here, Helen. Then I went to Europe
for several years and when we returned the house
had all been done over, your uncle&#8217;s family was
here, and I think&mdash;I am not sure&mdash;somebody told
me dear old Mary Boyle was dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; observed Helen, thoughtfully. &#8220;She is
not dead. She is only forgotten.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Van Ramsden looked at the Western girl
for some moments in silence. She seemed to understand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
the whole matter without a word of
further explanation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you mind letting me see Mary Boyle
while I am here?&#8221; she asked, gravely. &#8220;She
was a very lovely old soul, and all the families
hereabout&mdash;I have heard my mother often say&mdash;quite
envied the Starkweathers their possession of
such a treasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly we can go in and see her,&#8221; declared
Helen, throwing all discretion to the winds. &#8220;I
was going to read to her this afternoon, anyway.
Come along!&#8221;</p>
<p>She led the caller through the hall to Mary
Boyle&#8217;s little suite of rooms. To herself Helen
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Let the wild winds of disaster blow! Whew!
If the family hears of this I don&#8217;t know but they
will want to have me arrested&mdash;or worse! But
what can I do? And then&mdash;Mary Boyle deserves
better treatment at their hands.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>IN THE SADDLE</h3>
</div>

<p>The little old lady &#8220;tidied&#8221; her own room.
She hopped about like a bird with the aid of the
ebony crutch, and Helen and Miss Van Ramsden
heard the &#8220;step&mdash;put&#8221; of her movements when
they entered the first room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in, deary!&#8221; cried the dear old soul.
&#8220;I was expecting you. Ah, whom have we here?
Good-day to you, ma&#8217;am!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nurse Boyle! don&#8217;t you remember me?&#8221;
cried the visitor, going immediately to the old
lady and kissing her on both cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless us, now! How would I know ye?&#8221;
cried the old woman. &#8220;Is it me old eyes I have
set on ye for many a long year now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I blame myself for it, Nurse,&#8221; cried May
Van Ramsden. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember little May&mdash;the
Van Ramsdens&#8217; May&mdash;who used to come
to see you so often when she was about so-o
high?&#8221; cried the girl, measuring the height of a
five or six-year-old.</p>
<p>&#8220;A neighbor&#8217;s baby <i>did</i> come to see Old Mary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
now and then,&#8221; cried the nurse. &#8220;But you&#8217;re
never May?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am, Nurse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And growed so tall and handsome? Well,
well, well! It does bate all, so it does. Everybody
grows up but Mary Boyle; don&#8217;t they?&#8221;
and the old woman cackled out a sweet,
high laugh, and sat down to &#8220;visit&#8221; with her
callers.</p>
<p>The two girls had a very charming time with
Mary Boyle. And May Van Ramsden promised
to come again. When they left the old lady she
said, earnestly, to Helen:</p>
<p>&#8220;And there are others that will be glad to come
and see Nurse Boyle. When she was well and
strong&mdash;before she had to use that crutch&mdash;she
often appeared at our houses when there was trouble&mdash;serious
trouble&mdash;especially with the babies or
little children. And what Mary Boyle did not
know about pulling young ones out of the mires of
illness, wasn&#8217;t worth knowing. Why, I know a
dozen boys and girls whose lives were probably
saved by her. They shall be reminded of her
existence. And&mdash;it shall be due to you, Little
Cinderella!&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen smiled deprecatingly. &#8220;It will be due
to your own kind heart, Miss Van Ramsden,&#8221; she
returned. &#8220;I see that everybody in the city is not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
so busy with their own affairs that they cannot
think of other people.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young lady kissed her again and said goodbye.
But that did not end the matter&mdash;no, indeed!
The news that Miss Van Ramsden had
been taken to the topmost story of the Starkweather
mansion&mdash;supposedly to Helen&#8217;s own
room only&mdash;by the Western girl, dribbled through
the servants to Belle Starkweather herself when
she came home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Pa! I won&#8217;t stand that common little
thing being here any longer&mdash;no, I won&#8217;t! Why,
she did that just on purpose to make folks talk&mdash;to
make people believe that we abuse her. Of
course, she told May that <i>I</i> sent her to the top
story to sleep. You get rid of that girl, Pa, or I
declare I&#8217;ll go away. I guess I can find somebody
to take me in as long as you wish to keep Prince
Morrell&#8217;s daughter here in <i>my</i> place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahem! I&mdash;I must beg you to compose yourself,
Belle&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t&mdash;and that&#8217;s flat!&#8221; declared his eldest
daughter. &#8220;Either she goes; or I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do let Belle go, Pa,&#8221; drawled Flossie. &#8220;She
is getting too bossy, anyway. <i>I</i> don&#8217;t mind having
Helen here. She is rather good fun. And
May Van Ramsden came here particularly to
see Helen.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not so!&#8221; cried Belle, stamping her
foot.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is. Maggie heard her say so. Maggie was
coming up the stairs and heard May ask Helen to
take her to her room. What could the poor girl
do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahem! Flossie&mdash;I am amazed at you&mdash;amazed
at you!&#8221; gasped Mr. Starkweather.
&#8220;What do you learn at school?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness me! I couldn&#8217;t tell you,&#8221; returned
the youngest of his daughters, carelessly. &#8220;It&#8217;s
none of it any good, though, Pa. You might as
well take me out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told that girl to use the back stairs, and to
keep out of the front of the house,&#8221; went on Belle,
ignoring Flossie. &#8220;If she had not been hanging
about the front of the house, May Van Ramsden
would not have seen her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t so!&#8221; snapped Flossie.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Will</i> you be still, minx?&#8221; demanded the older
sister.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care. Let&#8217;s give Helen a fair deal. I
tell you, Pa, May said she came particularly to see
Helen. Besides, Helen had been in Hortense&#8217;s
room, and that is where May found her. Helen
was brushing Hortense&#8217;s hair. Hortense told me
so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahem! I am astonished at you, Flossie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
The fact remains that Helen is a source of trouble
in the house. I really do wish I knew how to
get rid of her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You give me permission, Pa,&#8221; sneered Belle,
&#8220;and I&#8217;ll get rid of her very quickly&mdash;you see!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; exclaimed the troubled father. &#8220;I&mdash;I
cannot use the iron hand at present&mdash;not at
present.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; exclaimed the shrewd Belle. &#8220;I&#8217;d
like to know what you are afraid of, Pa?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Starkweather tried to frown down his
daughter, but was unsuccessful. He merely presented
a picture of a very cowardly man trying to
look brave. It wasn&#8217;t much of a picture.</p>
<p>So&mdash;as may be easily conceived&mdash;Helen was not
met at dinner by her relatives in any conciliatory
manner. Yet the girl from the West really wished
she might make friends with Uncle Starkweather
and her cousins.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be that a part of the fault is with me,&#8221;
she told herself, when she crept up to her room
after a gloomy time in the dining-room. &#8220;If I
had it in me to please them&mdash;to make them happier&mdash;surely
they could not treat me as they do.
Oh, dear, I wish I had learned better how to be
popular.&#8221;</p>
<p>That night Helen felt about as bad as she had
any time since she arrived in the great city. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
was too disturbed to read. She lay in bed until
the small hours of the morning, unable to sleep,
and worrying over all her affairs, which seemed,
since she had arrived in New York, to go altogether
wrong.</p>
<p>She had not made an atom of progress in that
investigation which she had hoped would bring to
light the truth about the mystery which had sent
her father and mother West&mdash;fugitives&mdash;before
she was born. She had only succeeded in becoming
thoroughly suspicious of her Uncle Starkweather
and of Fenwick Grimes.</p>
<p>Nor had she made any advance in the discovery
of the mysterious Allen Chesterton, the bookkeeper
of her father&#8217;s old firm, who held, she believed,
the key to the mystery. She did not know
what step to take next. She did not know what
to do. And there was nobody with whom she
could consult&mdash;nobody in all this great city to
whom she could go.</p>
<p>Never before had Helen felt so lonely as she
did this night. She had money enough with her
to pay somebody to help her dig back for facts
regarding the disappearance of the money belonging
to the old firm of Grimes &amp; Morrell. But
she did not know how to go about getting the
help she needed.</p>
<p>Her only real confidante&mdash;Sadie Goronsky&mdash;would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
not know how to advise her in this emergency.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I had let Dud Stone give me his address.
He said he was learning to be a lawyer,&#8221;
thought Helen. &#8220;And just now, I s&#8217;pose, a lawyer
is what I need most. But I wouldn&#8217;t know how
to go about engaging a lawyer&mdash;not a good one.&#8221;</p>
<p>She awoke at her usual time next morning, and
the depression of the night before was still with
her. But when she jumped up she saw that it was
no longer raining. The sky was overcast, but she
could venture forth without running the risk of
spoiling her new suit.</p>
<p>And right there a desperate determination came
into Helen Morrell&#8217;s mind. She had learned that
on the west side of Central Park there was a riding
academy. She was <i>hungry</i> for an hour in the
saddle. It seemed to her that a gallop would
clear all the cobwebs away and make her feel like
herself once more.</p>
<p>The house was still silent and dark. She took
her riding habit out of the closet, made it up
into a bundle, and crept downstairs with it under
her arm. She escaped the watchful Lawdor for
once, and got out by the area door before even
the cook had crept, yawning, downstairs to begin
her day&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>Helen, hurrying through the dark, dripping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
streets, found a little restaurant where she could
get rolls and coffee on her way to the Columbus
Circle riding academy. It was still early when
the girl from Sunset Ranch reached her goal.
Yes, a mount was to be had, and she could change
her street clothes for her riding suit in the dressing-rooms.</p>
<p>The city&mdash;at least, that part of it around Central
Park&mdash;was scarcely awake when Helen walked
her mount out of the stable and into the park.
The man in charge had given her to understand
that there were few riders astir so early.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have the bridle-path to yourself, Miss,
going out,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Helen had picked up a little cap to wear, and
astride the saddle, with her hair tied with a big
bow of ribbon at the nape of her neck, she looked
very pretty as the horse picked his way across the
esplanade into the bridle-path. But there were
few, as the stableman had said, to see her so
early in the morning.</p>
<p>It did not rain, however. Indeed, there was a
fresh breeze which, she saw, was tearing the low-hung
clouds to shreds. And in the east a rosy
spot in the fog announced the presence of the sun
himself, ready to burst through the fleecy veil and
smile once more upon the world.</p>
<p>The trees and brush dripped upon the fallen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
leaves. For days the park caretakers had been unable
to rake up these, and they had become almost
a solid pattern of carpeting for the lawns. And
down here in the bridle-path, as she cantered
along, their pungent odor, stirred by the hoofs of
her mount, rose in her nostrils.</p>
<p>This wasn&#8217;t much like galloping over an open
trail on a nervous little cow-pony. But it was
both a bodily and mental relief for the outdoor
girl who had been, for these past weeks, shut into
a groove for which she was so badly fitted.</p>
<p>She saw nobody on horseback but a mounted
policeman, who turned and trotted along beside
her, and was pleasant and friendly. This pleased
Helen; and especially was she pleased when she
learned that he had been West and had &#8220;punched
cows&#8221; himself. That had been some years ago,
but he remembered the Link-A&mdash;now the Sunset&mdash;Ranch,
although he had never worked for that
outfit.</p>
<p>Helen&#8217;s heart expanded as she cantered along.
The sun dispelled the mist and shone warm upon
the path. The policeman left her, but now there
were other riders abroad. She went far out of
town, as directed by the officer, and found the ride
beautiful. After all, there were some lovely spots
in this great city, if one only knew where to find
them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></p>
<p>She had engaged a strong horse with good
wind; but she did not want to break him down.
So she finally turned her face toward the city
again and let the animal take its own pace
home.</p>
<p>She had ridden down as far as 110th Street
and had crossed over into the park once more,
when she saw a couple of riders advancing toward
her from the south. They were a young man and
a girl, both well mounted, and Helen noted instantly
that they handled their spirited horses
with ease.</p>
<p>Indeed, she was so much interested in the
mounts themselves, that she came near passing the
two without a look at their faces. Suddenly
she heard an exclamation from the young fellow,
she looked up, and found herself gazing straight
into the handsome face of Dudley Stone.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the love of heaven!&#8221; gasped that astonished
young man. &#8220;It surely <i>is</i> Helen Morrell!
Jess! See here! Here&#8217;s the very nicest girl who
ever came out of Montana!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dud&#8217;s sister&mdash;Helen knew she must be his sister,
for she had the same coloring as and a strong
family resemblance to the budding lawyer&mdash;wheeled
her horse and rode directly to Helen&#8217;s
side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Miss Morrell!&#8221; she cried, putting out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
her gauntleted hand. &#8220;Is it really she, Dud?
How wonderful!&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen shook hands rather timidly, for Miss
Jessie Stone was torrential in her speech. There
wasn&#8217;t a chance to &#8220;get a word in edgewise&#8221;
when once she was started upon a subject that
interested her.</p>
<p>&#8220;My goodness me!&#8221; she cried, still shaking
Helen&#8217;s hand. &#8220;Is this really the girl who pulled
you out of that tree, Dud? Who saved your life
and took you on her pony to the big ranch? My,
how romantic!</p>
<p>&#8220;And you really own a ranch, Miss Morrell?
How nice that must be! And plenty of cattle on
it&mdash;Why! you don&#8217;t mind the price of beef at
all; do you? And what a clever girl you must be,
too. Dud came back full of your praise, now I
tell you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There, there!&#8221; cried Dud. &#8220;Hold on a bit,
Jess, and let&#8217;s hear how Miss Morrell is&mdash;and
what she is doing here in the big city, and all
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I declare, Dud! You take the words
right out of my mouth,&#8221; said his sister, warmly.
&#8220;I was just going to ask her that. And we&#8217;re
going to the Casino for breakfast, Miss Morrell,
and you must come with us. You&#8217;ve had your
ride; haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;m just returning,&#8221; admitted Helen, rather
breathless, if Jess was not.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, then!&#8221; cried the good-natured but
talkative city girl. &#8220;Come, Dud, you ride ahead
and engage a table and order something nice.
I&#8217;m as ravenous as a wolf. Dear me, Miss Morrell,
if you have been riding long you must be
quite famished, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had coffee and rolls early,&#8221; said Helen, as
Dud spurred his horse away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what&#8217;s coffee and rolls? Nothing at all&mdash;nothing
at all! After I&#8217;ve been jounced around
on this saddle for an hour I feel as though I never
<i>had</i> eaten. I don&#8217;t care much for riding myself,
but Dud is crazy for it, and I come to keep him
company. You must ride with us, Miss Morrell.
How long are you going to stay in town? And
to think of your having saved Dud&#8217;s life&mdash;Well!
he&#8217;ll never get over talking about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He makes too much of the incident,&#8221; declared
Helen, determined to get in a word. &#8220;I only
lent him a rope and he saved himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. You carried him on your pony to that
ranch. Oh, I know it all by heart. He talks about
it to everybody. Dud is <i>so</i> enthusiastic about the
West. He is crazy to go back again&mdash;he wants
to live there. I tell him I&#8217;ll go out and try it for
a while, and if I find I can stand it, he can hang
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
out his shingle in that cow-town&mdash;what do you
call it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Elberon?&#8221; suggested Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;Elberon. Dud says there is a chance for
another lawyer there. And he came back here and
entered the offices of Larribee &amp; Polk right away,
so as to get working experience, and be entered at
the bar all the sooner. But say!&#8221; exclaimed Jess,
&#8220;I believe one reason why he is so eager to go back
to the West is because <i>you</i> live there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Miss Stone!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do call me Jess. &#8216;Miss Stone&#8217; is so stiff.
And you and I are going to be the very best of
friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I really hope so, Jess. But you must call me
Helen, too,&#8221; said the girl from Sunset Ranch.</p>
<p>Jess leaned out from her saddle, putting the
horses so close that the trappings rubbed, and
kissed the Western girl resoundingly on the cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just <i>loved</i> you!&#8221; said the warm-hearted
creature, &#8220;when Dud first told me about you. But
now that I see you in the flesh, I love you for your
very own self! I hope you&#8217;ll love me, too, Helen
Morrell&mdash;And you won&#8217;t mind if I talk a good
deal?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in the least!&#8221; laughed Helen. &#8220;And I
<i>do</i> love you already. I am so, so glad that you and
Dud both like me,&#8221; she added, &#8220;for my cousins
do not like me at all, and I have been very unhappy
since coming to New York.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here we are!&#8221; cried Jess, without noting
closely what her new friend said. &#8220;And there is
Dud waiting for us on the porch. Dear old Dud!
Whatever should I have done if you hadn&#8217;t got
him out of that tree-top, Helen?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>MY LADY BOUNTIFUL</h3>
</div>

<p>That was a wonderful breakfast at the Casino.
Not that Helen ever remembered much about
what she ate, although Dud had ordered choice
fruit and heartier food that would have tempted
the most jaded appetite instead of that of a healthy
girl who had been riding horseback for two hours
and a half.</p>
<p>But, it was so heartening to be with people at
the table who &#8220;talked one&#8217;s own language.&#8221; The
Stones and Helen chattered like a trio of young
crows. Dud threatened to chloroform his sister
so that he and Helen could get in a word or two
during Jess&#8217;s lapse into unconsciousness; but finally
<i>that</i> did not become necessary because of the
talkative girl&#8217;s interest in a story that Helen
related.</p>
<p>They had discussed many other topics before
this subject was broached. And it was the real
reason for Helen&#8217;s coming East to visit the
Starkweathers. &#8220;Dud&#8221; was &#8220;in the way of being
a lawyer,&#8221; as he had previously told her, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
Helen had come to realize that it was a lawyer&#8217;s
advice she needed more than anything else.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Jess, will you keep still long enough for
me to listen to the story of my very first client?&#8221;
demanded Dud, sternly, of his sister.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll stuff the napkin into my mouth! You
can gag me! Your very first client, Dud! And
it&#8217;s so interesting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is customary for clients to pay over a retainer;
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; queried Helen, her eyes dancing.
&#8220;How much shall it be, Mr. Lawyer?&#8221; and she
opened her purse.</p>
<p>There was the glint of a gold piece at the bottom
of the bag. Dud flushed and reached out his
hand for it.</p>
<p>&#8220;That five dollars, Miss Helen. Thank you.
I shall never spend this coin,&#8221; declared Dud,
earnestly. &#8220;And I shall take it to a jeweler&#8217;s and
have it properly engraved.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What will you have put on it?&#8221; asked Helen,
laughing.</p>
<p>He looked at her from under level brows, smiling
yet quite serious.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall have engraved on it &#8216;Snuggy, to Dud&#8217;&mdash;if
I may?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But Helen shook her head and although she still
smiled, she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better wait a bit, Mr. Lawyer, and see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
if your advice brings about any happy conclusion
of my trouble. But you can keep the gold
piece, just the same, to remember me by.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As though I needed <i>that</i> reminder!&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>Jess removed the corner of the napkin from between
her pretty teeth. &#8220;Get busy, do!&#8221; she
cried. &#8220;I&#8217;m dying to hear about this strange affair
you say you have come East to straighten out,
Helen.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the girl from Sunset Ranch told all her story.
Everything her father had said to her upon the
topic before his death, and all she suspected about
Fenwick Grimes and Allen Chesterton&mdash;even to
the attitude Uncle Starkweather took in the matter&mdash;she
placed before Dud Stone.</p>
<p>He gave it grave attention. Helen was not
afraid to talk plainly to him, and she held nothing
back. But at the best, her story was somewhat
disconnected and incomplete. She possessed very
few details of the crime which had been committed.
Mr. Morrell himself had been very hazy in his
statements regarding the affair.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we want first,&#8221; declared Dud, impressively,
&#8220;is to get the <i>facts</i>. Of course, at the
time, the trouble must have made some stir. It
got into the newspapers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear, yes,&#8221; said Helen. &#8220;And that is
what Uncle Starkweather is afraid of. He fears
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
it will get into the papers again if I make any
stir about it, and then there will be a scandal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With his name connected with it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s dreadfully timid for his own good name;
isn&#8217;t he?&#8221; remarked Dud, sarcastically. &#8220;Well,
first of all, I&#8217;ll get the date of the occurrence and
then search the files of all the city papers. The reporters
usually get such matters pretty straight.
To misstate such business troubles is skating on
the thin ice of libel, and newspapers are careful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, when we have all the facts before us&mdash;what
people surmised, even, and how it looked to
&#8216;the man on the street,&#8217; as the saying is&mdash;then
we&#8217;ll know better how to go ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you willing to leave the matter to me,
Helen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did I give you a retainer for?&#8221; demanded
the girl from Sunset Ranch, smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; he replied, his own eyes dancing;
&#8220;but there is a saying among lawyers that the
feminine client does not really come to a lawyer
for advice; rather, she pays him to listen to her
talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that horrid of him?&#8221; cried Jess, unable
to keep still any longer. &#8220;As though we girls
talked any more than the men do. I should say
not!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>But Helen agreed to let Dud govern her future
course in trying to untangle the web of circumstance
that had driven her father out of New
York years before. As Dud said, somebody was
guilty, and that somebody was the person they
must find.</p>
<p>It encouraged Helen mightily to have someone
talk this way about the matter. A solution of
the problem seemed so imminent after she parted
from the fledgling lawyer and his sister, that
Helen determined to hasten to their conclusion certain
plans she had made, before she returned to
the West.</p>
<p>For Helen could not remain here. Her uncle&#8217;s
home was not the refined household that dear dad
had thought, in which she would be sheltered and
aided in improving herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might as well take board at the Zoo and
live in the bear&#8217;s den,&#8221; declared Helen, perhaps a
little harsh in her criticism. &#8220;There are no civilizing
influences in <i>that</i> house. I&#8217;d never get a
particle of &#8216;culture&#8217; there. I&#8217;d rather associate
with Sing, and Jo-Rab, and the boys, and Hen
Billings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her experience in the great city had satisfied
Helen that its life was not for her. Some things
she had learned, it was true; but most of them
were unpleasant things.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather hire some lady to come out to Sunset
and live with me and teach me how to act
gracefully in society, and all that. There are a lot
of &#8216;poor, but proud&#8217; people who would be glad
of the chance, I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>But on this day&mdash;after she had left her riding
habit at a tailor&#8217;s to be brushed and pressed, and
had made arrangements to make her changes there
whenever she wished to ride in the morning&mdash;on
this day Helen had something else to do beside
thinking of her proper introduction to society.
This was the first day it had been fit for her to
go downtown since she and Sadie Goronsky had
had their adventure with the old man whom Sadie
called &#8220;Lurcher,&#8221; but whom Fenwick Grimes had
called &#8220;Jones.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen was deeply interested in the old man&#8217;s
case, and if he could be helped in any proper way,
she wanted to do it. Also, there was Sadie herself.
Helen believed that the Russian girl, with
her business ability and racial sharpness, could
help herself and her family much more than she
now was doing, if she had the right kind of a
chance.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I am going to give her the chance,&#8221;
Helen told herself, delightedly. &#8220;She has been,
as unselfish and kind to me&mdash;a stranger to her and
her people&mdash;as she could be. I am determined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
that Sadie Goronsky and her family shall always
be glad that Sadie was kind to the &#8216;greenie&#8217; who
hunted for Uncle Starkweather&#8217;s house on Madison
Street instead of Madison Avenue.&#8221;</p>
<p>After luncheon at the Starkweathers&#8217; Helen
started downtown with plenty of money in her
purse. She rode to Madison Street and was but
a few minutes in reaching the Finkelstein store.
To her surprise the front of the building was covered
with big signs reading &#8220;Bankrupt Sale!
Prices Cut in Half!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sadie was not in sight. Indeed, the store was
full of excited people hauling over old Jacob
Finkelstein&#8217;s stock of goods, and no &#8220;puller-in&#8221;
was needed to draw a crowd. The salespeople
seemed to have their hands full.</p>
<p>Not seeing Sadie anywhere, Helen ventured to
mount to the Goronsky flat. Mrs. Goronsky
opened the door, recognized her visitor, and in
shrill Yiddish and broken English bade her welcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;You gome py mein house to see mein Sarah?
Sure! Gome in! Gome in! Sarah iss home to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, see who&#8217;s here!&#8221; exclaimed Sadie, appearing
with a partly-completed hat, of the very
newest style, in her hand. &#8220;I thought the wet
weather had drowned you out.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It kept me in,&#8221; said Helen, &#8220;for I had nothing
fit to wear out in the rain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, business was so poor that Jacob had to
fail. And that always gives me a few days&#8217; rest.
I&#8217;m glad to get &#8217;em, believe me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why, can a man fail more than once?&#8221;
gasped Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;He can in the clothing business,&#8221; responded
Sadie, laughing, and leading the way into the tiny
parlor. &#8220;I bet there was a crowd in there when
you come by?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; agreed Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure! he&#8217;ll get rid of all the &#8216;stickers&#8217; he&#8217;s
got it in the shop, and when we open again next
week for ordinary business, everything will be
fresh and new.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, then, you&#8217;re really not out of a job?&#8221;
asked Helen, relieved for her friend&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;m all right. And you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I came down particularly to see about that
poor old man&#8217;s spectacles,&#8221; Helen said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you didn&#8217;t forget about him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed. Did you see him? Has he got
the prescription? Is it right about his eyes being
the trouble?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure that&#8217;s what the matter is. And he&#8217;s
dreadful poor, Helen. If he could see better he
might find some work. He wore his eyes out, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
told me, by writing in books. That&#8217;s a business!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he has the prescription.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. I seen it. He&#8217;s always hoping he&#8217;d get
enough money to have the glasses. That&#8217;s all he
needs, the doctor told him. But they cost fourteen
dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He shall have them!&#8221; declared Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean it, Helen?&#8221; cried the Russian
girl. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t got that much money for
him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have. Will you go around there with
me? We&#8217;ll get the prescription and have it
filled.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a bit,&#8221; said Sadie. &#8220;I want to finish
this hat. And lemme tell you&mdash;it&#8217;s right in style.
What do you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How wonderfully clever you are!&#8221; cried the
Western girl. &#8220;It looks as though it had just
come out of a shop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure it does. I could work in a hat shop.
Only they wouldn&#8217;t pay me anything at first, and
they wouldn&#8217;t let me trim. But I know a girl
that ain&#8217;t a year older nor me what gets sixteen
dollars a week trimming in a millinery store on
Grand Street. O&#8217; course, she ain&#8217;t the <i>madame</i>;
she&#8217;s only assistant. But sixteen dollars is a good
bunch of money to bring home on a Saturday
night&mdash;believe me!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is that what you&#8217;d like to do&mdash;keep a millinery
shop?&#8221; asked Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t I&mdash;just?&#8221; gasped Sadie. &#8220;Why,
Helen&mdash;I dream about it nights!&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen became suddenly interested. &#8220;Would a
little shop pay, Sadie? Could you earn your living
in a little shop of your own&mdash;say, right around
here somewhere?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! I&#8217;ve had me eye on a place for months.
But it ain&#8217;t no use. You got to put up for the
rent, and the wholesalers ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to let a girl
like me have stock on credit. And there&#8217;s the
fixtures&mdash;Aw, well, what&#8217;s the use? It&#8217;s only a
dream.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen was determined it should not remain
&#8220;only a dream.&#8221; But she said nothing further.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>THE HAT SHOP</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Them folks you&#8217;re living with must have had
a change of heart, Helen,&#8221; said Sadie Goronsky,
as the two girls sallied forth&mdash;Sadie with her new
hat set jauntily on her sleek head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you say that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they are willing to spend fourteen dollars
on old Lurcher&#8217;s eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it isn&#8217;t a member of my uncle&#8217;s family
who is furnishing the money for this charity,&#8221;
Helen replied. Sadie asked no further questions,
fortunately.</p>
<p>It was a very miserable house in which the old
man lodged. Helen&#8217;s heart ached as she beheld the
poverty and misery so evident all about her.
&#8220;Lurcher&#8221; lived on the top floor at the back&mdash;a
squalid, badly-lighted room&mdash;and alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;But a man with eyes as bad as mine don&#8217;t
really need light, you see, young ladies,&#8221; he whispered,
when Sadie had ushered herself and Helen
into the room.</p>
<p>He had tried to keep it neat; but his housekeeping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
arrangements were most primitive, and
cold as the weather had now become, he had no
stove save a one-wick oil stove on which he cooked
his meals&mdash;such as they were.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; Sadie told him, &#8220;this is my friend,
Helen, and she seen you the other day when you&mdash;you
lost that dollar, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, wonderful bright eyes you have, Miss,
to find a dollar in the street.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t they?&#8221; cried Sadie, grinning broadly
at Helen. &#8220;Chee, it ain&#8217;t everybody that can
pick up money in the streets of New York&mdash;though
we all believed we could before we come
over here from Russia. Sure!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said Helen, softly, &#8220;I had seen you
before, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Lurcher. I saw you over on the
West Side that morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You saw me over there?&#8221; asked the old man,
yet still in a very low voice&mdash;a sort of a faded-out
voice&mdash;and he seemed not a little startled.
&#8220;You saw me over there, Miss? <i>Where</i> did you
see me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On&mdash;on Bleecker Street,&#8221; responded Helen,
which was quite true. She saw that the man evidently
did not wish his visit to Fenwick Grimes to
be known. Perhaps he had some unpleasant connection
with the money-lender.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes!&#8221; said Lurcher, with relief. &#8220;I&mdash;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
come through there frequently. But I have such
difficulty in seeing my way about, that I follow
a beaten path&mdash;yes! a beaten path.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen was very curious about the old man&#8217;s
acquaintance with Fenwick Grimes. The more she
thought over her own interview with the money-lender
and mine-owner, the deeper became her
suspicion that her father&#8217;s one-time partner was
an untrustworthy man.</p>
<p>Anybody who seemed to know him better than
<i>she</i> did, naturally interested Helen. Dud Stone
had promised to find out all about Grimes, and
Helen knew that she would wait impatiently for
his report.</p>
<p>But she was interested in Lurcher for his own
miserable sake, too. He had lived by himself in
this wretched lodging for years. How he lived he
did not say; but it was evident that his income was
both infinitesimal and uncertain.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he was not a mean-looking man,
nor were his garments unclean. They <i>were</i>
ragged. He admitted, apologetically, that he
could not see to use a needle and so &#8220;had sort o&#8217;
got run down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come some day soon and mend you up,&#8221;
promised Helen, when the old man gave her the
prescription he had received from the oculist at
the Eye and Ear Hospital. &#8220;And you shall have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
these glasses just as soon as the lenses can be
ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God bless you, Miss!&#8221; said the old man,
simply.</p>
<p>He had a quiet, &#8220;listening&#8221; face, and seldom
spoke above a whisper. He was more the shadow
of a man than the substance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t that a terrible end to look forward to,
Helen?&#8221; remarked Sadie, seriously, as they descended
the stairs to the street. &#8220;He ain&#8217;t got
no friends, and no family, and no way to make a
decent livin&#8217;. They wouldn&#8217;t have the likes of
him around in offices, writin&#8217; in books.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you mean he is a bookkeeper?&#8221; cried
Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, I do. That&#8217;s a business! My papa is
going to be in business for himself again. And so
will I&mdash;you see! That&#8217;s the only way to get on,
and lay up something for your old age. Work
for yourself&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a millinery store; eh?&#8221; suggested Helen,
smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right!&#8221; declared Sadie, boldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the little store you spoke of? Do
you suppose you can ever get it, Sadie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t! You make me feel bad here,&#8221; said
Sadie, with her hand on her heart. &#8220;Say! I

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
East Side Four Hundred. The wholesale houses
let youse come there and work when they&#8217;re makin&#8217;
up the season&#8217;s pattern hats, and then you can get
all the new wrinkles. Oh, I wish I was goin&#8217; to
start next season in me own store instead of pullin&#8217;
greenies into Papa Yawcob&#8217;s suit shop,&#8221; and the
East Side girl sighed dolefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go see the shop you want,&#8221; suggested
Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! It don&#8217;t do no good,&#8221; said Sadie.
&#8220;But I often go out of my way to take a peek
at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went a little farther uptown and Helen
was shown the tiny little store which Sadie had
picked out as just the situation for a millinery
shop.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye see, there&#8217;s other stores all around; but no
millinery. Women come here to buy other things,
and if I had that little winder full of tasty hats&mdash;Chee!
wouldn&#8217;t it pull &#8217;em in?&#8221;</p>
<p>They stood there some minutes, while the young
East Side girl, so wise in the ways of earning a
living, so sharp of apprehension in most things,
told her whole heart to the girl who had never had
to worry about money matters at all&mdash;told it with
no suspicion that My Lady Bountiful stood by her
side.</p>
<p>She pointed out to Helen just where she would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
have her little counter, and the glass-fronted wall
cases for the trimmed hats, and the deep drawers
for &#8220;shapes,&#8221; and the little case in which to show
the flowers and buckles, and the chair and table and
mirror for the particular customers to sit at while
they were being fitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;d take that hunchback girl&mdash;Rosie
Seldt&mdash;away from the millinery store on my block&mdash;she
<i>hates</i> to work on the sidewalk the way they
make her&mdash;she could help me lots. Rosie is a
smart girl with some ideas of her own. And
I&#8217;d curtain off the end of the store down there
for a workroom, and for stock&mdash;Chee, but I&#8217;d
make this place look swell!&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen, who had noted the name and address
of the rental agent on the card in the window, cut
her visit with Sadie short, so afraid was she that
she would be tempted to tell her friend of the good
fortune that was going to overtake her. For
the girl from Sunset Ranch knew just what she
was going to do.</p>
<p>Dud Stone had given her the address of the law
firm where he was to be found, and the very next
morning she went to the offices of Larribee &amp; Polk
and saw Dud. In his hands she put a sum of
money and told him what she wished done. But
when Dud learned that the girl had the better part
of eight hundred dollars in cash with her, he took
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
her to a bank and made her open an account at
once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you think you are&mdash;still in the wild
and woolly West where pretty near everybody you
meet is honest?&#8221; demanded Dud. &#8220;You ought
to be shaken! That money here in the big city
is a temptation to half the people you pass on the
street. Suppose one of the servants at your uncle&#8217;s
house should see it? You have no right to put
temptation in people&#8217;s way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen accepted his scolding meekly as long as he
did not refuse to carry out her plan for Sadie
Goronsky. When Dud heard the full particulars
of the Western girl&#8217;s acquaintanceship with Sadie,
he had no criticism to offer. That very day Dud
engaged the store, paid three months&#8217; rent, and
bought the furnishings. Sadie was not to be told
until the store was ready for occupancy. There
was still time enough. Helen knew that the millinery
season did not open until February.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, although Helen&#8217;s goings and comings
were quite ignored by Uncle Starkweather
and the girls, some incidents connected with Helen
Morrell had begun to stir to its depth the fountain
of the family&#8217;s wrath against the girl from
Sunset Ranch.</p>
<p>Twice May Van Ramsden had come to call on
Helen. Once she had brought Ruth and Mercy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
De Vorne with her. And on each occasion she
had demanded that Gregson take their cards to
Helen.</p>
<p>Gregson had taken the cards up one flight and
then had sent on the cards by Maggie to Helen&#8217;s
room. Gregson said below stairs that he would
&#8220;give notice&#8221; if he were obliged to take cards
to anybody who roomed in the attic.</p>
<p>May and her friends trooped up the stairs in
the wake of their cards, however&mdash;for so it had
been arranged with Helen, who expected them on
both occasions.</p>
<p>The anger of the Starkweather family would
have been greater had they known that these calls
of their own most treasured social acquaintances
were really upon the little old lady who had been
shut away into the front attic suite, and whose existence
even was not known to some of the servants
in the Starkweather mansion.</p>
<p>May, as she had promised, was bringing, one
or two at a time, her friends who, as children when
Cornelius Starkweather was alive, had haunted
this old house because they loved old Mary Boyle.
And May was proving, too, to the Western girl,
that all New York people of wealth were neither
heartless or ungrateful. Yet the crime of forgetfulness
these young women must plead to.</p>
<p>The visits delighted Mary Boyle. Helen knew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
that she slept better&mdash;after these little excitements
of the calls&mdash;and did not go pattering up
and down the halls with her crutch in the dead of
night.</p>
<p>So the days passed, each one bringing so much
of interest into the life of Helen Morrell that
she forgot to be lonely, or to bewail her lot. She
was still homesick for the ranch&mdash;when she stopped
to think about it. But she was willing to wait a
while longer before she flitted homeward to Big
Hen and the boys.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>THE MISSING LINK</h3>
</div>

<p>Helen met Dud Stone and his sister on the
bridle-path one morning by particular invitation.
The message had come to the house for her late
the evening before and had been put into the
trusty hand of old Lawdor, the butler. Dud had
learned the particulars of the old embezzlement
charge against Prince Morrell.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got here in typewriting the reports from
three papers&mdash;everything they had to say about
it for the several weeks that it was kept alive as a
news story. It was not so great a crime that the
metropolitan papers were likely to give much
space to it,&#8221; Dud said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can read over the reports at your leisure,
if you like. But the main points for us to know are
these:</p>
<p>&#8220;In the two banks were, in the names of Morrell
&amp; Grimes, something over thirty-three thousand
dollars. Either partner could draw the
money. The missing bookkeeper could <i>not</i> draw
the money.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The checks came to the banks in the course of
the day&#8217;s business, and neither teller could swear
that he actually remembered giving the money to
Mr. Morrell; yet because the checks were signed in
his name, and apparently in his handwriting, they
both &#8216;thought&#8217; it must have been Mr. Morrell
who presented the checks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, mind you, Fenwick Grimes had gone off
on a business trip of some duration, and Allen
Chesterton had disappeared several days before
the checks were drawn and the money removed
from the banks.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was hinted by one ingenious police reporter
that the bookkeeper was really the guilty man. He
even raked up some story of the man at his lodgings
which intimated that Chesterton had some art
as an actor. Parts of disguises were found abandoned
at his empty rooms. This suggestion was
made: That Chesterton was a forger and had disguised
himself as Mr. Morrell so as to cash the
checks without question. Then Fenwick Grimes
returned and discovered that the bank balances
were gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;At first your father was no more suspected than
was Grimes himself. Then, one paper printed an
article intimating that your father, the senior partner
of the firm, might be the criminal. You see,
the bank tellers had been interviewed. Before that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
the suggestion that by any possibility Mr. Morrell
was guilty had been scouted. But the next day it
was learned your father and mother had gone
away. Immediately the bookkeeper was forgotten
and the papers all seemed to agree that Prince
Morrell had really stolen the money.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oddly enough the creditors made little trouble
at first. Your Uncle Starkweather was mentioned
as having been a silent partner in the concern
and having lost heavily himself&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor dad was able to pay Uncle Starkweather
first of all&mdash;years and years ago,&#8221; interposed
Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! and Grimes? Do you know if he made
any claim on your father at any time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not. You see, he was freed of all debt
almost at once through bankruptcy. Mr. Grimes
really had a very small financial interest in the
firm. Dad said he was more like a confidential
clerk. Both he and Uncle Starkweather considered
Grimes a very good asset to the firm, although
he had no money to put into it. That is the way
it was told to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And very probable. This Grimes is notoriously
sharp,&#8221; said Dud, reflectively. &#8220;And right
after he went through bankruptcy he began to do
business as a money-lender. Supposedly he lent
other people&#8217;s money; but he is now worth a million,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
or more. Question is: Where did he get his
start in business after the robbery and the failure
of Grimes &amp; Morrell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Dud!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you suspect him, too?&#8221; demanded the
young man.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I am prejudiced, I fear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; agreed Dud, with a grim chuckle.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going after that man Grimes. It&#8217;s funny he
should go into business with a mysterious capital
right after the old firm was closed out, when before
that he had had no money to invest in the firm
of which he was a member.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I feared as much,&#8221; sighed Helen. &#8220;And he was
so eager to throw suspicion on the lost bookkeeper,
just to satisfy my curiosity and put me off the track.
He&#8217;s as bad as Uncle Starkweather. <i>He</i> doesn&#8217;t
want me to go ahead because of the possible scandal,
and Mr. Grimes is afraid for his own sake,
I very much fear. What a wicked man he
must be!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly,&#8221; said Dud, eyeing the girl sharply.
&#8220;Have you told me all your uncle has said to
you about the affair?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so, Dud. Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, nothing much. Only, in hunting
through the files of the newspapers for articles
about the troubles of Grimes &amp; Morrell I came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
across the statement that Mr. Starkweather was
in financial difficulties about the same time. <i>He</i>
settled with his creditors for forty cents on the
dollar. This was before your uncle came into <i>his</i>
uncle&#8217;s fortune, of course, and went to live on
Madison Avenue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;is that significant?&#8221; asked the girl,
puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that it is. But there is something
you mentioned just now that <i>is</i> of importance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that, Dud?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, the bookkeeper&mdash;Allen Chesterton.
He&#8217;s the missing link. If we could get him I believe
the truth would easily be learned. In one
newspaper story of the Grimes &amp; Morrell trouble,
it was said that Grimes and Chesterton had
been close friends at one time&mdash;had roomed together
in the very house from which the bookkeeper
seemed to have fled a couple of days before
the embezzlement was discovered.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would detectives be able to pick up any clue
to the missing man&mdash;and missing link?&#8221; asked
Helen, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a cold trail,&#8221; Dud observed, shaking his
head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind spending some money. I can
send to Big Hen for more&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you can. I don&#8217;t believe you realize
how rich you are, Helen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I never had to think about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. But about hiring a detective. I hate to
waste money. Wait a few days and see if I can
get on the blind side of Mr. Grimes in some way.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the matter rested; but it was Helen herself
who made the first discovery which seemed to point
to a weak place in Fenwick Grimes&#8217;s armor.</p>
<p>Helen had been once to the poor lodging of
Mr. Lurcher to &#8220;mend him up&#8221;; for she was a
good little needlewoman and she knew she could
make the old fellow look neater. He had got his
glasses, and at first could only wear them a part
of the day. The doctor at the hospital gave him
an ointment for his eyelids, too, and he was on
a fair road to recovery.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can cobble shoes pretty good, Miss,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;And there is work to be had at that industry
in several shops in the neighborhood. Once
I was a clerk; but all that is past, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen did not propose to let the old fellow suffer;
but just yet she did not wish to do anything
further for him, or Sadie might suspect that her
friend, Helen, was something different from the
poor girl Sadie thought she was.</p>
<p>After the above interview with Dud, Helen
went downtown to see Sadie again; and she ran
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
around the corner to spend a few minutes with
Mr. Lurcher. As she went up the stairs she
passed a man coming down. It was dark, and she
could not see the person clearly. Yet Helen realized
that the individual eyed her sharply, and even
stopped and came part way up the stairs again to
see where she went.</p>
<p>When she came down to the street again she
was startled by almost running into Mr. Grimes,
who was passing the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;What! what! what!&#8221; he snapped, staring at
her. &#8220;What brings you down in <i>this</i> neighborhood?
A nice place for Mr. Willets Starkweather&#8217;s
niece to be seen in. I warrant he doesn&#8217;t
know where you are?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are quite right, Mr. Grimes,&#8221; Helen returned,
quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221; asked Grimes,
rather rudely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Visiting friends,&#8221; replied Helen, without further
explanation.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re still trying to rake up that old trouble
of your father&#8217;s?&#8221; demanded Grimes, scowling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not down here,&#8221; returned Helen, with a
quiet smile. &#8220;That is sure. But I <i>am</i> doing
what I can to learn all the particulars of the affair.
Mr. Van Ramsden was a creditor and father&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
friend, and his daughter tells me that <i>he</i> will do
all in his power to help me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha! Van Ramsden! Well, it&#8217;s little you&#8217;ll
ever find out through <i>him</i>. Well! you&#8217;d much
better have let me do as I suggested and cleared
up the whole story in the newspapers,&#8221; growled
Grimes. &#8220;Now, now! Where&#8217;s that clerk of
mine, I wonder? He was to meet me here.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he went muttering along the walk; but
Helen stood still and gazed after him in some bewilderment.
For it dawned on the girl that the
man who had passed her as she went up to see old
Mr. Lurcher, or &#8220;Jones,&#8221; was Leggett, Fenwick
Grimes&#8217;s confidential man.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>THEIR EYES ARE OPENED</h3>
</div>

<p>As her cousins were not at all interested in what
became of Helen during the day, neither was
Helen interested in how the three Starkweather
girls occupied their time. But on this particular
afternoon, while Helen was visiting Lurcher, and
chatting with Sadie Goronsky on the sidewalk in
front of the Finkelstein shop, she would have been
deeply interested in what interested the Starkweather
girls.</p>
<p>All three chanced to be in the drawing-room
when Gregson came past the door in his stiffest
manner, holding the tray with a single card on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it, Gregson?&#8221; asked Belle. &#8220;I heard
the bell ring. Somebody to see me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, mem, it his not,&#8221; declared the footman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221; said Hortense, holding out her hand.
&#8220;Who is it, I wonder?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor is hit for you, mem,&#8221; repeated Gregson.</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be for <i>me</i>?&#8221; cried Flossie.</p>
<p>But before the footman could speak again, Belle
rose majestically and crossed the room.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I know what it is,&#8221; she said, angrily.
&#8220;And it is going to stop. You were going to take
the card upstairs, Gregson?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, mem!&#8221; said Gregson, somewhat heated.
&#8220;Hi do not carry cards above the second floor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s somebody to see Helen!&#8221; cried Flossie,
clapping her hands softly and enjoying her older
sister&#8217;s rage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give it to me!&#8221; exclaimed Belle, snatching the
card from the tray. She turned toward her sisters
to read it. But when her eye lit upon the
name she was for the moment surprised out of
speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness me! who is it?&#8221; gasped Hortense.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jessie Stone&mdash;&#8216;Miss Jessie Dolliver Stone.&#8217;
Goodness me!&#8221; whispered Belle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not the Stones of Riverside Drive&mdash;<i>the</i>
Stones?&#8221; from Hortense.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dud Stone&#8217;s sister?&#8221; exclaimed Flossie.</p>
<p>&#8220;And Dud Stone is the very nicest boy I ever
met,&#8221; quoth Hortense, clasping her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know Miss Jessie. Jess, they all call her.
I saw her on the Westchester Links only last week
and she never said a word about this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About coming to see Helen&mdash;it isn&#8217;t possible!&#8221;
cried Hortense. &#8220;Gregson, you have
made a mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi beg your pardon&mdash;no, mem. She asked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
for Miss Helen. I left &#8217;er in the reception parlor,
mem&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She thinks one of us is named Helen!&#8221; cried
Belle, suddenly. &#8220;Show her up, Gregson.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gregson might have told her different; but he
saw it would only involve him in more explanation;
therefore he turned on his heel and in his
usual stately manner went to lead Dud Stone&#8217;s
sister into the presence of the three excited girls.</p>
<p>Jessie by no means understood the situation at
the Starkweather house between Helen and her
cousins. It had never entered Miss Stone&#8217;s head,
in fact, that anybody could be unkind to, or dislike,
&#8220;such a nice little thing as Helen Morrell.&#8221;</p>
<p>So she greeted the Starkweather girls in her
very frankest manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really am delighted to see you again, Miss
Starkweather,&#8221; Jess said, being met by Belle at the
door. &#8220;And are these your sisters? I&#8217;m charmed,
I am sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hortense and Flossie were introduced. The
girls sat down.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say Helen isn&#8217;t here?&#8221;
demanded Jess. &#8220;I came particularly to invite her
to dinner to-morrow night. We&#8217;re going to have
a little celebration and Dud and I are determined
to have her with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Helen?&#8221; gasped Belle.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not Helen Morrell?&#8221; demanded Hortense.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes&mdash;of course&mdash;your Cousin Helen.
How funny! Of course she&#8217;s here? She lives
with you; doesn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;er&mdash;we have a&mdash;a distant relative of
poor mamma&#8217;s by that name,&#8221; said Belle, haughtily.
&#8220;She&mdash;she came here quite unexpectedly&mdash;er quite
uninvited, I may say. Pa is <i>so-o</i> easy,
you know; he won&#8217;t send her away&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Send her away! Send Helen Morrell away?&#8221;
gasped Jess Stone. &#8220;Are&mdash;are we talking about
the same girl, I wonder? Why, Helen is a most
charming girl&mdash;and pretty as a picture. And
brave no end!</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it was she who saved my brother&#8217;s life
when he was away out West&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Stone never went to Montana?&#8221; cried
Flossie. &#8220;He never met Helen at Sunset
Ranch?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be still, Floss!&#8221; commanded Belle; but Miss
Stone turned to answer the younger girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. Dud stopped at the ranch some
days, too. He had to, for he hurt his foot. That&#8217;s
when Helen saved his life. He was flung from
the back of a horse over the edge of a cliff and
fortunately landed in the top of a tree.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the tree was very tall and he could not
have gotten out of it safely with his wounded foot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
had not Helen ridden up to the brink of the precipice,
thrown him a rope, and swung him out of
the tree upon a ledge of rock. Then he worked
his way down the side of the cliff while Helen
caught his horse. But his foot hurt him so that
he could never have got into the saddle alone;
and Helen put him on her own pony and led
the pony to the ranch house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bully for Helen!&#8221; ejaculated Flossie, under
her breath. Even Hortense was flushed a bit
over the story. But Belle could see nothing to admire
in her cousin from the West, and she only
said, harshly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Very likely, Miss Stone. Helen seems to be
a veritable hoyden. These ranch girls are so unfortunate
in their bringing up and their environment.
In the wilds I presume Helen may be passable;
but she is quite, quite impossible here in the
city&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you mean by being &#8216;impossible,&#8217;&#8221;
interrupted Jess Stone. &#8220;She is a
lovely girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t met her?&#8221; cried Belle. &#8220;It&#8217;s
only Mr. Stone&#8217;s talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly <i>have</i> met her, Miss Starkweather.
Certainly I know her&mdash;and know her well. Had
I known when she was coming to New York I
would have begged her to come to us. It is plain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
that her own relatives do not care much for Helen
Morrell,&#8221; said the very frank young lady.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;we&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Helen has been meeting me in the bridle-path
almost every morning. And she rides wonderfully.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Riding in Central Park!&#8221; cried Hortense.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why, the child has nothing decent to
wear,&#8221; declared Belle. &#8220;How could she get a
riding habit&mdash;or hire a horse? I do not understand
this, Miss Stone, but I can tell you right
now, that Helen has nothing fit to wear to your
dinner party. She came here a little pauper&mdash;with
nothing fit to wear in her trunk. Pa <i>did</i>
find money enough for a new street dress and hat
for her; but he did not feel that he could support
in luxury every pauper who came here and claimed
relationship with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Stone&#8217;s mouth fairly hung open, and her
eyes were as round as eyes could be, with wonder
and surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is this you tell me?&#8221; she murmured.
&#8220;Helen Morrell a pauper?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I presume those people out there in Montana
wanted to get the girl off their hands,&#8221; said Belle,
coldly, &#8220;and merely shipped her East, hoping that
Pa would make provision for her. She has been a
great source of annoyance to us, I do assure you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A source of annoyance?&#8221; repeated the caller.</p>
<p>&#8220;And why not? Without a rag decent to wear.
With no money. Scarcely education enough to
make herself intelligibly understood&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Flossie began to giggle. But Jessie Stone rose
to her feet. This volatile, talkative girl could be
very dignified when she was aroused.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are speaking of <i>my</i> friend, Helen Morrell,&#8221;
she interrupted Belle&#8217;s flow of angry language,
sternly. &#8220;Whether she is your cousin, or
not, she is <i>my</i> friend, and I will not listen to you
talk about her in that way. Besides, you must be
crazy if you believe your own words! Helen Morrell
poor! Helen Morrell uneducated!</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Helen was four years in one of the best
preparatory schools of the West&mdash;in Denver. Let
me tell you that Denver is some city, too. And
as for being poor and having nothing to wear&mdash;Why,
whatever can you mean? She owns one of
the few big ranches left in the West, with thousands
upon thousands of cattle and horses upon
it. And her father left her all that, and perhaps a
quarter of a million in cash or investments beside.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not Helen?&#8221; shrieked Belle, sitting down
very suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Little Helen&mdash;<i>rich</i>?&#8221; murmured Hortense.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does Helen really <i>own</i> Sunset Ranch?&#8221; cried
Flossie, eagerly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She certainly does&mdash;every acre of it. Why,
Dud knows all about her and all about her affairs.
If you consider that girl poor and uneducated you
have fooled yourselves nicely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of it! I&#8217;m glad of it!&#8221; exclaimed
Flossie, clapping her hands and pirouetting about
the room. &#8220;Serves you right, Belle! <i>I</i> found out
she knew a whole lot more than I did, long ago.
She&#8217;s been helping me with my lessons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And she <i>is</i> a nice little thing,&#8221; joined in Hortense,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what you say to the contrary,
Belle. She was the only one in this house that
showed me any real sympathy when I was sick&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Belle only looked at her sisters, but could say
nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if Helen hasn&#8217;t anything fit to wear to
your party to-morrow night, I will lend her something,&#8221;
declared Hortense.</p>
<p>&#8220;You need not bother,&#8221; said Jess, scornfully.
&#8220;If Helen came in the plainest and most miserable
frock to be found she would be welcome.
Good-day to you, Miss Starkweather&mdash;and Miss
Hortense&mdash;and Miss Flossie.&#8221;</p>
<p>She swept out of the room and did not even
need the gorgeous Gregson to show her to the
door.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>THE PARTY</h3>
</div>

<p>Helen chanced that evening to be entering the
area door just as Mr. Starkweather himself was
mounting the steps of the mansion. Her uncle
recognized the girl and scowled over the balustrade
at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to the den at once; I wish to speak to
you Helen&mdash;Ahem!&#8221; he said in his most severe
tones.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; responded the girl respectfully, and
she passed up the back stairway while Mr. Starkweather
went directly to his library. Therefore
he did not chance to meet either of his daughters
and so was not warned of what had occurred
in the house that afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Helen,&#8221; said Uncle Starkweather, viewing her
with the same stern look when she approached his
desk. &#8220;I must know how you have been using
your time while outside of my house? Something
has reached my ear which greatly&mdash;ahem!&mdash;displeases
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; The girl was really at a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
loss what to say. She did not know what he was
driving at and she doubted the advisability of
telling Uncle Starkweather everything that she
had done while here in the city as his guest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was told this afternoon&mdash;not an hour ago&mdash;that
you have been seen lurking about the most
disreputable parts of the city. That you are a
frequenter of low tenement houses; that you associate
with foreigners and the most disgusting of
beggars&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you would stop, Uncle,&#8221; said Helen,
quickly, her face flushing now and her eyes sparkling.
&#8220;Sadie Goronsky is a nice girl, and her
family is respectable. And poor old Mr. Lurcher
is only unfortunate and half-blind. He will not
harm me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Beggars! Yiddish shoestring pedlars! A
girl like you! Where&mdash;ahem!&mdash;<i>where</i> did you
ever get such low tastes, girl?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t blame yourself, Uncle,&#8221; said Helen,
with some bitterness. &#8220;I certainly did not learn
to be kind to poor people from <i>your</i> example.
And I am sure I have gained no harm from being
with them once in a while&mdash;only good. To help
them a little has helped me&mdash;I assure you!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Mr. Starkweather listened not at all to this.
&#8220;Where did you find these low companions?&#8221; he
demanded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I met Sadie the night I arrived here in the
city. The taxicab driver carried me to Madison
Street instead of Madison Avenue. Sadie was kind
to me. As for old Mr. Lurcher, I saw him first
in Mr. Grimes&#8217;s office.&#8221;</p>
<p>Uncle Starkweather suddenly lost his color and
fell back in his chair. For a moment or two he
seemed unable to speak at all. Then he stammered:</p>
<p>&#8220;In Fenwick Grimes&#8217;s office?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&mdash;what was this&mdash;ahem!&mdash;this beggar
doing there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he is a beggar, perhaps he was begging. At
least, Mr. Grimes seemed very anxious to get rid
of him, and gave him a dollar to go away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you followed him?&#8221; gasped Mr. Starkweather.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I went to see Sadie, and it seems Mr.
Lurcher lives right in that neighborhood. I found
he needed spectacles and was half-blind and
I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me nothing more about it! Nothing
more about it!&#8221; commanded her uncle, holding up
a warning hand. &#8220;I will not&mdash;ahem!&mdash;listen.
This has gone too far. I gave you shelter&mdash;an act
of charity, girl! And you have abused my confidence
by consorting with low company, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
spending your time in a mean part of the town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are wrong, sir. I have done nothing of
the kind,&#8221; said Helen, firmly, but growing angry
herself, now. &#8220;My friends are decent people, and
a poor part of the city does not necessarily mean
a criminal part.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush! How dare you contradict me?&#8221; demanded
her uncle. &#8220;You shall go home. You
shall go back to the West at once! Ahem! At
once. I could not assume the responsibility of your
presence here in my house any longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I will find a position and support myself,
Uncle Starkweather. I have told you I could
do that before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Starkweather,
at once. &#8220;I will not allow it. You are not to
be trusted in this city. I shall send you back to
that place you came from&mdash;ahem!&mdash;Sunset Ranch,
is it? That is the place for a girl like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Uncle&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No more! I will listen to nothing else from
you,&#8221; he declared, harshly. &#8220;I shall purchase
your ticket through to-morrow, and the next day
you must go. Ahem! Remember that I <i>will</i> be
obeyed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen looked at him with tear-dimmed eyes for
fully a minute. But he said no more and his stern
countenance, as well as his unkind words and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
tone, repelled her. She put out her hand once, as
though to speak, but he turned away, scornfully.</p>
<p>It was her last attempt to soften him toward
her. He might then, had he not been so selfish
and haughty, have made his peace with the girl
and saved himself much trouble and misery in the
end. But he ignored her, and Helen, crying
softly, left the room and stole up to her own place
in the attic.</p>
<p>She could not see anybody that evening, and so
did not go down to dinner. Later, to her amazement,
Maggie came to her door with a tray piled
high with good things&mdash;a very elaborate repast,
indeed. But Helen was too heartsick to eat much,
although she did not refuse the attention&mdash;which
she laid to the kindness of Lawdor, the butler.</p>
<p>But for once she was mistaken. The tray of
food did not come from Lawdor. Nor was it the
outward semblance of anybody&#8217;s kindness. The
tray delivered at Helen&#8217;s door was the first result
of a great fright!</p>
<p>At dinner the girls could not wait for their father
to be seated before they began to tell him of
the amazing thing that had been revealed to them
that afternoon by Jessie Stone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Cousin Helen, Gregson?&#8221; asked
Belle, before seating herself. &#8220;See that she is
called. She may not have heard the gong.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span></p>
<p>If Gregson&#8217;s face could display surprise, it displayed
it then.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, dear Helen has returned; hasn&#8217;t
she?&#8221; added Hortense.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go up myself and see if she&#8217;s here,&#8221; Flossie
suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahem!&#8221; said the surprised Mr. Starkweather.</p>
<p>&#8220;I listened sharply for her, but I did not hear
her pass my door,&#8221; said Hortense.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must ask her to come back to that spare room
on the lower floor,&#8221; sighed Belle. &#8220;She is too
far away from the rest of the family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls!&#8221; gasped Mr. Starkweather, at length
finding speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you needn&#8217;t explode, Pa!&#8221; ejaculated
Belle. &#8220;We are aware of something about Helen
that changes the complexion of affairs entirely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does this mean?&#8221; demanded Mr.
Starkweather, blankly. &#8220;Something about
Helen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed, Pa,&#8221; said Flossie, spiritedly.
&#8220;Who do you suppose owns that Sunset Ranch
she talks about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And who do you suppose is worth a quarter of
a million dollars&mdash;more than <i>you</i> are worth, Pa,
I declare?&#8221; cried Hortense.</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls!&#8221; exclaimed Belle. &#8220;That is very low.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
If we have made a mistake regarding Cousin
Helen, of course it can be adjusted. But we need
not be vulgar enough to say <i>why</i> we change
toward her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Starkweather thumped upon the table with
the handle of his knife.</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls!&#8221; he commanded. &#8220;I will have this
explained. What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>Out it came then&mdash;in a torrent. Three girls
can do a great deal of talking in a few minutes&mdash;especially
if they all talk at once.</p>
<p>But Mr. Starkweather got the gist of it. He
understood what it all meant, and he realized what
it meant to <i>him</i>, as well, better than his daughters
could.</p>
<p>Prince Morrell, whom he had always considered
a bit of a fool, and therefore had not even
inquired about after he left for the West, had died
a rich man. He had left this only daughter, who
was an heiress to great wealth. And he, Willets
Starkweather, had allowed the chance of a lifetime
to slip through his fingers!</p>
<p>If he had only made inquiries about the girl and
her circumstances! He might have done that when
he learned that Mr. Morrell was dead. When
Helen had told him her father wished her to be in
the care of her mother&#8217;s relatives, Mr. Starkweather
could have then taken warning and learned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
the girl&#8217;s true circumstances. He had not even
accepted her confidences. Why, he might have
been made the guardian of the girl, and handled all
her fortune!</p>
<p>These thoughts and a thousand others raced
through the scheming brain of the man. Could
he correct his fault at this late date? If he had
only known of this that his daughters had learned
from Jess Stone, before he had taken Helen to
task as he had that very evening!</p>
<p>Fenwick Grimes had telephoned to him at his
office. Something Mr. Grimes had said&mdash;and he had
not seen Mr. Grimes nor talked personally with
him for years&mdash;had put Mr. Starkweather into a
great fright. He had decided that the only safe
place for Helen Morrell was back in the West&mdash;he
supposed with the poor and ignorant people on
the ranch where her father had worked.</p>
<p>Where Prince Morrell had <i>worked</i>! Why, if
Morrell had owned Sunset Ranch, Helen was one
of the wealthiest heiresses in the whole Western
country. Mr. Starkweather had asked a few questions
about Sunset Ranch of men who knew. But,
as the owner had never given himself any publicity,
the name of Morrell was never connected
with it.</p>
<p>While the three girls chattered over the details
of the story Mr. Starkweather merely played with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
his food, and sat staring into a corner of the room.
He was trying to scheme his way out of the difficulty&mdash;the
dangerous difficulty, indeed&mdash;in which
he found himself.</p>
<p>So, his first move was characteristic. He sent
the tray upstairs to Helen. But none of the family
saw Helen again that night.</p>
<p>However, there was another caller. This was
May Van Ramsden. She did not ask for Helen,
however, but for Mr. Starkweather himself, and
that gentleman came graciously into the room
where May was sitting with the three much excited
sisters.</p>
<p>Belle and Hortense and Flossie were bubbling
over with the desire to ask Miss Van Ramsden if
<i>she</i> knew that Helen was a rich girl and not a poor
one. But there was no opportunity. The caller
broached the reason for her visit at once, when she
saw Mr. Starkweather.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going to ask a great favor of you, sir,&#8221;
she said, shaking hands. &#8220;And it does seem like
a very great impudence on our part. But please
remember that, as children, we were all very
much attached to her. You see,&#8221; pursued Miss
Van Ramsden, &#8220;there are the De Vorne girls, and
Jo and Nat Paisley, and Adeline Schenk, and
some of the Blutcher boys and girls&mdash;although the
younger ones were born in Europe&mdash;and Sue Livingstone,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
and Crayton Ballou. Oh! there really
is a score or more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahem!&#8221; said Mr. Starkweather, not only
solemnly, but reverently. These were names he
worshipped. He could have refused such young
people nothing&mdash;nothing!&mdash;and would have told
Miss Van Ramsden so had what she said next not
stricken him dumb for the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, some of us have called on Nurse
Boyle, and found her so bright and so delighted
with our coming, that we want to give her a little
tea-party to-morrow afternoon. It would be so
delightful to have her greet the girls and boys
who used to be such friends of hers in the time of
Mr. Cornelius, right up there in those cunning
rooms of hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We always used to see her in the nursery
suite, and there are the same furniture, and hangings,
and pictures, and all. And Nurse Boyle
herself is just the same&mdash;only a bit older&mdash;Ah!
girls!&#8221; she added, turning suddenly to the three
sisters, &#8220;you don&#8217;t know what it means to have
been cared for, and rocked, and sung to, when
you were ill, perhaps, by Mary Boyle! You
missed a great deal in not having a Mary Boyle in
your family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Mary Boyle!</i>&#8221; gasped Mr. Starkweather.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Can we all come to see her to-morrow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
afternoon? I am sure if you tell Mrs. Olstrom,
your housekeeper will attend to all the arrangements.
Helen knows about it, and she&#8217;ll help pour
the tea. Mary thinks there is nobody quite like
Helen.&#8221;</p>
<p>These shocks were coming too fast for Mr.
Starkweather. Had anything further occurred
that evening to torment him it is doubtful if he
would have got through it as gracefully as he did
through this call. May Van Ramsden went away
assured that no obstacle would be placed in the
way of Mary Boyle&#8217;s party in the attic. But
neither Mr. Starkweather, nor his three daughters,
could really look straight into each other&#8217;s faces
for the remainder of that evening. And they were
all four remarkably silent, despite the exciting
things that had so recently occurred to disturb
them.</p>
<p>In the morning Helen got an invitation from
Jess Stone to dinner that evening. She said &#8220;come
just as you are&#8221;; but she did not tell Helen that
she had innocently betrayed her true condition to
the Starkweathers. Helen wrote a long reply and
sent it by special messenger through old Lawdor,
the butler. Then she prepared for the tea in Mary
Boyle&#8217;s rooms.</p>
<p>At breakfast time Helen met the family for the
first time since the explosion. Self-consciousness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
troubled the countenances and likewise the manner
of Mr. Starkweather and his three daughters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahem! A very fine morning, Helen. Have
you been out for your usual ramble, my dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How-do, Helen? Hope you&#8217;re feeling quite
fit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me, Helen! How pretty your hair is,
child. You must show me how you do it in that
simple way.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Flossie was more honest. She only nodded
to Helen at first. Then, when Gregson was out
of the room, she jumped up, went around the table
swiftly, and caught the Western girl about the
neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Helen! I&#8217;m just as ashamed of myself as I
can be!&#8221; she cried, her tears flowing copiously.
&#8220;I treated you so mean all the time, and you have
been so very, very decent about helping me in my
lessons. Forgive me; will you? Oh, please say
you will!&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen kissed her warmly. &#8220;Nothing to forgive,
Floss,&#8221; she said, a little bruskly, perhaps.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t let&#8217;s speak about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She merely bowed and said a word in reply to
the others. Nor could Mr. Starkweather&#8217;s unctuous
conversation arouse her interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a part in the very worthy effort to
liven up old Nurse Boyle, I understand?&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
Mr. Starkweather, graciously. &#8220;Is there anything
needed that I can have sent in, Helen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, sir. I am only helping Miss Van
Ramsden,&#8221; Helen replied, timidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think May Van Ramsden should have told
<i>me</i> of her plans,&#8221; said Belle, tossing her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or, <i>me</i>,&#8221; rejoined Hortense.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pah!&#8221; snapped Flossie. &#8220;None of us ever
cared a straw for the old woman. Queer old thing.
I thought she was more than a little cracked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Flossie!&#8221; ejaculated Mr. Starkweather,
angrily, &#8220;unless you can speak with more respect
for&mdash;ahem!&mdash;for a faithful old servitor of the
Starkweather family, I shall have to&mdash;ahem!&mdash;ask
you to leave the table.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t have to ask me&mdash;I&#8217;m going!&#8221; exclaimed
Flossie, flirting out of her chair and picking
up her books. &#8220;But I want to say one thing
while I&#8217;m on my way,&#8221; observed the slangy
youngster: &#8220;You&#8217;re all just as tiresome as you can
be! Why don&#8217;t you own up that you&#8217;d never have
given the old woman a thought if it wasn&#8217;t for
May Van Ramsden and her friends&mdash;and Helen?&#8221;
and she beat a retreat in quick order.</p>
<p>It was an unpleasant breakfast for Helen, and
she retired from the table as soon as she could.
She felt that this attitude of the Starkweathers
toward her was really more unhappy than their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
former treatment. For she somehow suspected
that this overpowering kindness was founded upon
a sudden discovery that she was a rich girl instead
of an object of charity. How well-founded this
suspicion was she learned when she and Jess met.</p>
<p>Hortense brought her up two very elaborate
frocks that forenoon, one for her to wear when she
poured tea in Mary Boyle&#8217;s rooms, and the
other for her to put on for the Stones&#8217; dinner
party.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will just about fit you. I&#8217;m a mite taller,
but that won&#8217;t matter,&#8221; said the languid Hortense.
&#8220;And really, Helen, I am just as sorry as I can be
for the mean way you have been treated while
you have been here. You have been so good-natured,
too, in helping a chap. Hope you won&#8217;t
hold it against me&mdash;and <i>do</i> wear the dresses,
dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will put on this one for the afternoon,&#8221; said
Helen, smiling. &#8220;But I do not need the evening
dress. I never wore one quite&mdash;quite like that,
you see,&#8221; as she noted the straps over the shoulders
and the low corsage. &#8220;But I thank you just
the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later Belle said to her airily: &#8220;Dear Cousin
Helen! I have spoken to Gustaf about taking you
to the Stones&#8217; in the limousine to-night. And he
will call for you at any hour you say.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot avail myself of that privilege, Belle,&#8221;
responded Helen, quietly. &#8220;Jess will send for me
at half-past six. She has already arranged to do
so. Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was so much going on above stairs that
day that Helen was able to escape most of the
oppressive attentions of her cousins. Great baskets
of flowers were sent in by some of the young
people who remembered and loved Mary Boyle,
and Helen helped to arrange them in the little
old lady&#8217;s rooms.</p>
<p>Tea things for a score of people came in, too.
And cookies and cakes from the caterer&#8217;s. At
three o&#8217;clock, or a little after, the callers began
to arrive. Belle, and Hortense, and Flossie received
them in the reception hall, had them remove
their cloaks below stairs, and otherwise tried to
make it appear that the function was really of their
own planning.</p>
<p>But nobody invited either of the Starkweather
girls upstairs to Mary Boyle&#8217;s rooms. Perhaps
it was an oversight. But it certainly <i>did</i> look as
though they had been forgotten.</p>
<p>But the party on the attic floor was certainly a
success. How pretty the little old lady looked,
sitting in state with all the young and blooming
faces about her! Here were growing up into
womanhood and manhood (for some of the boys
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
had not been ashamed to come) the children whom
she had tended and played with and sung to.</p>
<p>And she sung to them again&mdash;verses of forgotten
songs, lullabies she had crooned over some of
their cradles when they were ill, little broken
chants that had sent many of them, many times, to
sleep.</p>
<p>Altogether it was a most enjoyable afternoon,
and Nurse Boyle was promised that it should not
be the last tea-party she would have. &#8220;If you are
&#8217;way up here in the top of the house, you shall no
more be forgotten,&#8221; they told her.</p>
<p>Helen was the object next in interest to Nurse
Boyle. May Van Ramsden had told about the
Starkweathers&#8217; little &#8220;Cinderella Cousin&#8221;; and although
none of these girls and boys who had gathered
knew the truth about Helen&#8217;s wealth and
her position in life, they all treated her cordially.</p>
<p>When they trooped away and left the little old
lady to lie down to recuperate after the excitement,
Helen went to her own room, and remained
closely shut up for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>At half-past six she came downstairs, bag in
hand. She descended the servants&#8217; staircase, told
Mr. Lawdor that her trunk, packed and locked,
was ready for the expressman when he came, and
so stole out of the area door. She escaped any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
interview with her uncle, or with the girls. She
could not bid them good-by, yet she was determined
not to go back to Sunset Ranch on the
morrow, nor would she remain another night under
her uncle&#8217;s roof.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>A STATEMENT OF FACT</h3>
</div>

<p>Dud Stone had that very day seen the fixtures
put into the little millinery store downtown, and it
was ready for Sadie Goronsky to take charge;
there being a fund of two hundred dollars to
Sadie&#8217;s credit at a nearby bank, with which she
could buy stock and pay her running expenses for
the first few weeks.</p>
<p>Yet Sadie didn&#8217;t know a thing about it.</p>
<p>This last was the reason Helen went downtown
early in the morning following the little dinner
party at the Stones&#8217;. At that party Helen had met
the uncle, aunt, and cousins of Dud and Jess Stone,
with whom the orphaned brother and sister lived,
and she had found them a most charming family.</p>
<p>Jess had invited Helen to bring her trunk and
remain with her as long as she contemplated staying
in New York, and this Helen was determined
to do. Even if the Starkweathers would not let
the expressman have her trunk, she was prepared
to blossom out now in a butterfly outfit, and take
the place in society that was rightfully hers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span></p>
<p>But Helen hadn&#8217;t time to go shopping as yet.
She was too eager to tell Sadie of her good fortune.
Sadie was to be found&mdash;cold as the day was&mdash;pacing
the walk before Finkelstein&#8217;s shop, on
the sharp lookout for a customer. But there were
a few flakes of snow in the air, the wind from the
river was very raw, and it did seem to Helen as
though the Russian girl was endangering her
health.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what can poor folks do?&#8221; demanded
Sadie, hoarsely, for she already had a heavy cold.
&#8220;There is nothing for me to do inside the store.
If I catch a customer I make somet&#8217;ings yet.
Well, we must all work!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some other kind of work would be easier,&#8221;
suggested Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;But not so much money, maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you only had your millinery store.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make me laugh! Me lip&#8217;s cracked,&#8221;
grumbled Sadie. &#8220;Have a heart, Helen! I ain&#8217;t
never goin&#8217; to git a store like I showed you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sadie was evidently short of hope on this cold
day. Helen seized her arm. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go up and
look at that store again,&#8221; she urged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have a heart, I tell ye!&#8221; exclaimed Sadie
Goronsky. &#8220;Whaddeyer wanter rub it in for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, if we run it will help warm you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All ri&#8217;. Come on,&#8221; said Sadie, with deep disgust,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
but she started on a heavy trot towards the
block on which her heart had been set. And when
they rounded the corner and came before the little
shop window, Sadie stopped with a gasp of amazement.</p>
<p>Freshly varnished cases, and counter, and drawers,
and all were in the store just as she had
dreamed of them. There were mirrors, too, and
in the window little forms on which to set up the
trimmed hats and one big, pink-cheeked, dolly-looking
wax bust, with a great mass of tow-colored
hair piled high in the very latest mode, on which
was to be set the very finest hat to be evolved in
that particular East Side shop.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha&mdash;wha&mdash;what&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go in and look at it,&#8221; said Helen,
eagerly, seizing her friend&#8217;s arm again.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, no!&#8221; gasped Sadie. &#8220;We can&#8217;t.
It ain&#8217;t open. Oh, oh, oh! Somebody&#8217;s got <i>my</i>
shop!&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen produced the key and opened the door.
She fairly pushed the amazed Russian girl inside,
and then closed the door. It was nice and warm.
There were chairs. There was a half-length partition
at the rear to separate the workroom from
the showroom. And behind that partition were
low sewing chairs to work in, and a long work-table.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></p>
<p>Helen led the dazed Sadie into this rear room
and sat her down in one of the chairs. Then she
took one facing her and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you sit right there and make up in your
mind the very prettiest hat for <i>me</i> that you can
possibly invent. The first hat you trim in this
store must be for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Helen! Helen!&#8221; cried Sadie, almost wildly.
&#8220;You&#8217;re crazy yet&mdash;or is it me? I don&#8217;t know
what you mean&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you do, dear,&#8221; replied Helen, putting
her arms about the other girl&#8217;s neck. &#8220;You were
kind to me when I was lost in this city. You were
kind to me just for nothing&mdash;when I appeared
poor and forlorn and&mdash;and a greenie! Now, I
am sorry that it seemed best for me to let your
mistake stand. I did not tell my uncle and cousins
either, that I was not as poor and helpless as I
appeared.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re rich?&#8221; shrieked Sadie. &#8220;You&#8217;re
doing this yourself? This is <i>your</i> store?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it is <i>your</i> store,&#8221; returned Helen, firmly.
&#8220;Of course, by and by, when you are established
and are making lots of money, if you can
ever afford to pay me back, you may do so. The
money is yours without interest until that time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I got to cry, Helen! I got to cry!&#8221; sobbed
Sadie Goronsky. &#8220;If an angel right down out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
heaven had done it like you done it, I&#8217;d worship
him on my knees. And you&#8217;re a rich girl&mdash;not a
poor one?&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen then told her all about herself, and all
about her adventures since coming alone to New
York. But after that Sadie wanted to keep telling
her how thankful she was for the store, and
that Helen must come home and see mommer, and
that mommer must be brought to see the shop, too.
So Helen ran away. She could not bear any more
gratitude from Sadie. Her heart was too full.</p>
<p>She went over to poor Lurcher&#8217;s lodgings and
climbed the dark stairs to his rooms. She had
something to tell him, as well.</p>
<p>The purblind old man knew her step, although
she had been there but a few times.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in, Miss. Yours are angel&#8217;s visits, although
they are more frequent than angel&#8217;s visits
are supposed to be,&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do hope you are keeping off the street this
weather, Mr. Lurcher,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If you can
mend shoes I have heard of a place where they will
send work to you, and call for it, and you can
afford to have a warmer and lighter room than
this one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, my dear Miss! that is good of you&mdash;that
is good of you,&#8221; mumbled the old man. &#8220;And
why you should take such an interest in <i>me</i>&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I feel sure that you would be interested in me,
if I were poor and unhappy and you were rich
and able to get about. Isn&#8217;t that so?&#8221; she said,
laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye. Truly. And you <i>are</i> rich, my dear
Miss?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very rich, indeed. Father was one of the big
cattle kings of Montana, and Prince Morrell&#8217;s Sunset
Ranch, they tell me, is one of the <i>great</i> properties
of the West.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man turned to look at her with some
eagerness. &#8220;That name?&#8221; he whispered.
&#8220;<i>Who</i> did you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;my father, Prince Morrell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father? Prince Morrell your father?&#8221;
gasped the old man, and sat down suddenly, shaking
in every limb.</p>
<p>The girl instantly became excited, too. She
stepped quickly to him and laid her hand upon
his shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever know my father?&#8221; she asked
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I once knew a Mr. Prince Morrell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it here in New York you knew him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. It was years ago. He&mdash;he was a good
man. I&mdash;I had not heard of him for years. I
was away from the city myself for ten years&mdash;in
New Orleans. I went there suddenly to take the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
position of head bookkeeper in a shipping firm.
Then the firm failed, my health was broken by the
climate, and I returned here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen was staring at him in wonder and almost
in alarm. She backed away from him a bit toward
the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me your real name!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;It&#8217;s
not Lurcher. Nor is it Jones. No! don&#8217;t tell me.
I know&mdash;I know! You are Allen Chesterton, who
was once bookkeeper for the firm of Grimes &amp;
Morrell!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>&#8220;THE WHIP HAND&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>An hour later Helen and the old man hurried
out of the lodging house and Helen led him across
town to the office where Dudley Stone worked.
At first the old man peered all about, on the watch
for Fenwick Grimes or his clerk.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have been after me every few days to
agree to leave New York. I did not know what
for, but I knew Fenwick was up to some game.
He always <i>was</i> up to some game, even when we
were young fellows together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now he is rich, and he might have found me
better lodgings and something to do. But after
I came back from the South and was unfit to do
clerical work because of my eyes, he only threw
me a dollar now and then&mdash;like throwing a bone
to a starving dog.&#8221;</p>
<p>That explained how Helen had chanced to see
the old man at Fenwick Grimes&#8217;s door on the occasion
of her visit to her father&#8217;s old partner. And
later, in the presence of Dudley Stone&mdash;who was
almost as eager as Helen herself&mdash;the old man related
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
the facts that served to explain the whole
mystery surrounding the trouble that had darkened
Prince Morrell&#8217;s life for so long.</p>
<p>Briefly, Allen Chesterton and Fenwick Grimes
had grown up together in the same town, as boys
had come to New York, and had kept in touch
with each other for years. Neither had married
and for years they had roomed together.</p>
<p>But Chesterton was a plodding bookkeeper and
would never be anything else. Grimes was mad
for money, but he was always complaining that
he never had a chance.</p>
<p>His chance came through Willets Starkweather,
when the latter&#8217;s brother-in-law was looking for
a working partner&mdash;a man right in Grimes&#8217;s line,
and who was a good salesman. Grimes got into
the firm on very limited capital, yet he was a
trusted member and Prince Morrell depended on
his judgment in most things.</p>
<p>Allen Chesterton had been brought into the
firm&#8217;s office to keep the books through Grimes&#8217;s
influence, of course. By and by it seemed to Chesterton
that his old comrade was running pretty
close to the wind. The bookkeeper feared that <i>he</i>
might be involved in some dubious enterprise.</p>
<p>There was flung in Chesterton&#8217;s way (perhaps
<i>that</i> was by the influence of Grimes, too) a chance
to go to New Orleans to be bookkeeper in a shipping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
firm. He could get passage upon a vessel belonging
to the firm.</p>
<p>He had this to decide between the time of leaving
the office one afternoon and early the next
morning. He took the place and bundled his
things aboard, leaving a letter for Fenwick
Grimes. That letter, it is needless to say, Grimes
never made public. And by the time the slow craft
Chesterton was on reached her destination, the
firm of Grimes &amp; Morrell had gone to smash,
Morrell was a fugitive, and the papers had ceased
to talk about the matter.</p>
<p>The true explanation of the mystery was now
plain. Chesterton said that it was not himself, but
Grimes, who had been successful as an amateur
actor. Grimes had often disguised himself so well
as different people that he might have made something
by the art in a &#8220;protean turn&#8221; on the vaudeville
stage.</p>
<p>Chesterton had known all about the thirty-three
thousand dollars belonging to Morrell &amp; Grimes
in the banks. Grimes had hinted to his friend
how easy it would be to sequestrate this money
without Morrell knowing it. At first, evidently,
Grimes had wished to use the bookkeeper as a
tool.</p>
<p>Then he improved upon his plan. He had gotten
rid of Chesterton by getting him the position
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
at a distance. His going out of town himself had
been merely a blind. He had imitated Prince
Morrell so perfectly&mdash;after forging the checks
in his partner&#8217;s handwriting&mdash;that the tellers of
the two banks had thought Morrell really guilty
as charged.</p>
<p>&#8220;So Fenwick Grimes got thirty-three thousand
dollars with which to begin business on, after the
bankruptcy proceedings had freed him of all
debts,&#8221; said Dud Stone, reflectively. &#8220;Yet there
must have been one other person who knew, or
suspected, his crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who could that be?&#8221; cried Helen. &#8220;Surely
Mr. Chesterton is guiltless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Personally I would have taken the old man&#8217;s
statement without his swearing to it. <i>That</i> is the
confidence I have in him. I only wished it to be
put into affidavit form that it might be presented
to the courts&mdash;if necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If necessary?&#8221; repeated Helen, faintly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, my dear girl, you now have the whip
hand,&#8221; said Dud. &#8220;You can make the man&mdash;or
men&mdash;who ill-used your father suffer for the
crime&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, is there more than Grimes? Are you
<i>sure</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that there is another who <i>knew</i>.
Either legally, or morally, he is guilty. In either
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
case he was and is a despicable man!&#8221; exclaimed
Dud, hotly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean my uncle,&#8221; observed Helen, quietly.
&#8220;I know you do. How do you think he benefited
by this crime?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe he had a share of the money. He
held Grimes up, undoubtedly. Grimes is the bigger
criminal in a legal sense. But Starkweather
benefited, I believe, after the fact. And <i>he</i> let
your father remain in ignorance&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And let poor dad pay him back the money
he was supposed to have lost in the smashing
of the firm?&#8221; murmured Helen. &#8220;Do&mdash;do you
think he was paid twice&mdash;that he got money from
both Grimes and father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll prove that by Grimes,&#8221; said the fledgling
lawyer who, in time, was likely to prove himself
a successful one indeed.</p>
<p>He sent for Mr. Grimes to come to see him
on important business. When the money-lender
arrived, Dud got him into a corner immediately,
showed the affidavit, and hinted that Starkweather
had divulged something.</p>
<p>Immediately Grimes accused Helen&#8217;s uncle of
exactly the part in the crime Dud had suspected
him of committing. After the affair blew over
and Grimes had set up in business, Starkweather
had come to him and threatened to tell certain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
things which he knew, and others that he suspected,
unless he was given the money he had originally
invested in the firm of Grimes &amp; Morrell.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shut his mouth. That&#8217;s all he took&mdash;his
rightful share; but I&#8217;ve got his receipts, and I can
make it look bad for him. And I <i>will</i> make it look
bad for that old stiff-and-starched hypocrite if he
lets me be driven to the wall.&#8221;</p>
<p>This defiance of Fenwick Grimes closed the case
as far as any legal proceedings were concerned.
The matter of recovering the money from Grimes
would have to be tried in the civil courts. All the
creditors of the firm were satisfied. To get
Grimes indicted for his old crime would be a difficult
matter in New York County.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have the whip hand,&#8221; Dud Stone told
the girl from Sunset Ranch again. &#8220;If you want
satisfaction, you can spread the story broadcast by
means of the newspapers, and you will involve
Starkweather in it just as much as you will Grimes.
And between you and me, Helen, I think Willets
Starkweather richly deserves just that punishment.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>HEADED WEST</h3>
</div>

<p>Just at this time Helen Morrell wasn&#8217;t thinking
at all about wreaking vengeance upon those who
might have ill-treated her when she was alone in
the great city. Instead, her heart was made very
tender by the delightful things that were being
done for her by those who loved and admired the
sturdy little girl from Sunset Ranch.</p>
<p>In the first place, Jess and Dud Stone, and their
cousins, gave Helen every chance possible to see
the pleasanter side of city life. She had gone
shopping with the girls and bought frocks and hats
galore. Indeed, she had had to telegraph to Big
Hen for more money. She got the money; but
likewise she received the following letter:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Dear Snuggy:&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;We lets colts get inter the alfalfa an&#8217; kick up
their heels for a while; but they got to steady
down and come home some time. Ain&#8217;t you kicked
up your heels sufficient in that lonesome city? And
it looks like somebody was getting money away
from you&mdash;or have you learnt to spend it down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
East there? Come on home, Snuggy! The hull
endurin&#8217; ranch is jest a-honin&#8217; for you. Sing&#8217;s
that despondint I expects to see him cut off his
pigtail. Jo-Rab has gone back on his rice-and-curry
rations, the Greasers don&#8217;t plunk their mandolins
no more, and the punchers are as sorry
lookin&#8217; as winter-kept steers. Come back, Snuggy,
and liven up the old place, is the sincere wish of,
yours warmly,</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Henry Billings</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>Helen only waited to see some few matters
cleared up before she left for the West. As it
happened, Dud Stone obtained a chance to represent
a big corporation for some months, in Elberon
and Helena. His smattering of legal
knowledge was sufficient to enable him to accept
the job. It was a good chance for Jess to go out,
too, and try the climate and the life, over both of
which her brother was so enthusiastic.</p>
<p>But she would go to Sunset Ranch to remain
for some time if Helen went West with them and&mdash;of
course&mdash;Helen was only too glad to agree to
such a proposition.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Western girl was taken to museums,
and parks, and theaters, and all kinds of
show places, and thoroughly enjoyed herself. May
Van Ramsden and others of those who had attended
Mary Boyle&#8217;s tea party in the attic of the
Starkweather house hunted Helen out, too, in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
home of her friends on Riverside Drive, and the
last few weeks of Helen&#8217;s stay were as wonderful
and exciting as the first few weeks had been lonely
and sad.</p>
<p>Dud had insisted upon publishing the facts of
the old trouble which had come upon the firm of
Grimes &amp; Morrell, in pamphlet form, including
Allen Chesterton&#8217;s affidavit, and this pamphlet
was mailed to the creditors of the old firm and
to all of Prince Morrel&#8217;s old friends in New
York. But nothing was said in the printed matter
about Willets Starkweather.</p>
<p>Fenwick Grimes took a long trip out of town,
and made no attempt to put in an answer to the
case. But Mr. Starkweather was a very much
frightened man.</p>
<p>Dud came home one afternoon and advised
Helen to go and see her uncle. Since her departure
from the Starkweather mansion she had
seen neither the girls nor Uncle Starkweather
himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t know what you are going to do
with him. He brought the money he received
from your father to my office; but, of course, I
would not accept it. You&#8217;ve got the whip hand,
Helen&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I do not propose to crack the whip,
Dud,&#8221; declared the Western girl, quickly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a good chap, Snuggy!&#8221; exclaimed
Dud, warmly, and Helen smiled and forgave him
for using the intimate nickname.</p>
<p>But Helen went across town the very next day
and called upon her uncle. This time she mounted
the broad stone steps, instead of descending to
the basement door.</p>
<p>Gregson opened the door and, by his manner,
showed that even with the servants the girl from
Sunset Ranch was upon a different footing in her
uncle&#8217;s house. Mr. Starkweather was in his den
and Helen was ushered into the room without
crossing the path of any other member of the
family.</p>
<p>&#8220;Helen!&#8221; he ejaculated, when he saw her, and
to tell the truth the girl was shocked by his
changed appearance. Mr. Starkweather was quite
broken down. The cloud of scandal that seemed
to be menacing him had worn his pomposity to
a thread, and his dignified &#8220;Ahem!&#8221; had quite
disappeared.</p>
<p>Indeed, to see this once proud and selfish man
fairly groveling before the daughter of the man he
had helped injure in the old times, was not a
pleasant sight. Helen cut the interview as short as
she could.</p>
<p>She managed to assure Uncle Starkweather that
he need have no apprehension. That he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
known all the time Grimes was guilty, and that he
had benefited from that knowledge, was the sum
and substance of Willets Starkweather&#8217;s connection
with the old crime. At that time he had been,
as Dud Stone learned, in serious financial difficulties.
He used the money received from
Grimes&#8217;s ill-gotten gains, to put himself on his
feet.</p>
<p>Then had come the death of old Cornelius
Starkweather and the legacy. After that, when
Prince Morrell sent Starkweather the money he
was supposed to have lost in the bankruptcy of
Grimes &amp; Morrell, Starkweather did not dare refuse
it. He feared always that it would be discovered
he had known who was really guilty of
the embezzlement.</p>
<p>Flossie met Helen in the hall and hugged her.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you go away mad at me, Helen,&#8221; she
cried. &#8220;I know we all treated you mean; but&mdash;but
I guess I wouldn&#8217;t act that way again, to any
girl, no matter what Belle does.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not believe you would, Floss,&#8221; agreed
Helen, kissing her warmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And are you really going back to that lovely
ranch?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very soon. And some time, if you care to
and your father will let you, I&#8217;ll be glad to have
you come out there for a visit.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Bully for you, Helen! I&#8217;ll surely come,&#8221; cried
Flossie.</p>
<p>Hortense was on hand to speak to her cousin,
too. &#8220;You are much too nice a girl to bear malice,
I am sure, Helen,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But we do not
deserve very good treatment at your hands. I
hope you will forgive us and, when you come to
New York again, come to visit us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure you would not treat me again as you
did this time,&#8221; said Helen, rather sternly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can be sure we wouldn&#8217;t. Not even Belle.
She&#8217;s awfully sorry, but she&#8217;s too proud to say
so. She wants father to bring old Mary Boyle
downstairs into the old nursery suite that she used
to occupy when Uncle Cornelius was alive; only
the old lady doesn&#8217;t want to come. She says she&#8217;s
only a few more years at best to live and she doesn&#8217;t
like changes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helen saw the nurse before she left the house,
and left the dear old creature very happy indeed.
Helen was sure Nurse Boyle would never be so
lonely again, for her friends had remembered
her.</p>
<p>Even Mrs. Olstrom, the housekeeper, came to
shake hands with the girl who had been tucked
away into an attic bedroom as &#8220;a pauper cousin.&#8221;
And old Mr. Lawdor fairly shed tears when he
learned that he was not likely to see Helen again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span></p>
<p>There were other people in the great city who
were sorry to see Helen Morrell start West.
Through Dud Stone, Allen Chesterton had been
found light work and a pleasant boarding place.
There would always be a watchful eye upon the
old man&mdash;and that eye belonged to Miss Sadie
Goronsky&mdash;rather, &#8220;S. Goron, Milliner,&#8221; as the
new sign over the hat shop door read.</p>
<p>&#8220;For you see,&#8221; said Miss Sadie, with a toss of
her head, &#8220;there ain&#8217;t no use in advertisin&#8217; it that
you are a Yid. <i>That</i> don&#8217;t do no good, as I tell
mommer. Sure, I&#8217;m proud I&#8217;m a Jew. We&#8217;re
the greatest people in the world yet. But it ain&#8217;t
good for business.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, &#8216;Goron&#8217; sounds Frenchy; don&#8217;t it,
Helen? And when I get a-going down here good,
I&#8217;ll be wantin&#8217; some time to look at a place on
Fift&#8217; Av&#8217;ner, maybe. &#8216;Madame Goron&#8217; would
be dead swell&mdash;yes? But you put the &#8216;sky&#8217; to it
and it&#8217;s like tying a can to a dog&#8217;s tail. There ain&#8217;t
nowhere to go then but <i>home</i>,&#8221; declared this
worldly wise young girl.</p>
<p>Helen had dinner again with the Goronskys, and
Sadie&#8217;s mother could not do enough to show her
fondness for her daughter&#8217;s benefactor. Sadie
promised to write to Helen frequently and the
two girls&mdash;so much alike in some ways, yet as far
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
apart as the poles in others&mdash;bade each other an
affectionate farewell.</p>
<p>The next day Helen Morrell and her two
friends, Dud and Jess Stone, were headed West.
That second trip across the continent was a very
different journey for Helen than the first had been.</p>
<p>She and Jess Stone had become the best of
friends. And as the months slid by the two girls&mdash;Helen,
a product of the West, and Jessie, a product
of the great Eastern city&mdash;became dearer and
dearer companions.</p>
<p>As for Dud&mdash;of course he was always hanging
around. His sister sometimes wondered&mdash;and
that audibly&mdash;how he found time for business, he
was so frequently at Sunset Ranch. This was
only said, however, in wicked enjoyment of his
discomfiture&mdash;and of Helen&#8217;s blushes.</p>
<p>For by that time it was an understood thing
about Sunset Ranch that in time Dud was going to
have the right to call its mistress &#8220;Snuggy&#8221; for
all the years of her life&mdash;just as her father had.
And Helen, contemplating this possibility, did
not seem to mind.</p>

<p style=' font-size:; margin-top:; margin-bottom:1em;'>AND HER BOOKS FOR GIRLS</p>
</div>

<p>In these days, when the printing presses are
turning out so many books for girls that are good,
bad and indifferent, it is refreshing to come upon
the works of such a gifted authoress as Miss Amy
Bell Marlowe, who is now under contract to write
exclusively for Messrs. Grosset &amp; Dunlap.</p>
<p>In many ways Miss Marlowe&#8217;s books may be
compared with those of Miss Alcott and Mrs.
Meade, but all are thoroughly modern and wholly
American in scene and action. Her plots, while
never improbable, are exceedingly clever, and her
girlish characters are as natural as they are interesting.</p>
<p>On the following pages will be found a list
of Miss Marlowe&#8217;s books. Every girl in our
land ought to read these fresh and wholesome
tales. They are to be found at all booksellers.
Each volume is handsomely illustrated and bound
in cloth, stamped in colors. Published by Grosset

Marlowe&#8217;s books may be had for the asking.</p>

<p>THE OLDEST OF FOUR</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any way out!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Natalie&#8217;s mother who said that, after
the awful news had been received that Mr. Raymond
had been lost in a shipwreck on the Atlantic.
Natalie was the oldest of four children, and the
family was left with but scant means for support.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to do something&mdash;yes, I&#8217;ve just got
to!&#8221; Natalie said to herself, and what the brave
girl did is well related in &#8220;The Oldest of Four;
Or, Natalie&#8217;s Way Out.&#8221; In this volume we
find Natalie with a strong desire to become a
writer. At first she contributes to a local paper,
but soon she aspires to larger things, and comes
in contact with the editor of a popular magazine.
This man becomes her warm friend, and not only
aids her in a literary way but also helps in a hunt
for the missing Mr. Raymond.</p>
<p>Natalie has many ups and downs, and has to
face more than one bitter disappointment. But
she is a plucky girl through and through.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the brightest girls&#8217; stories ever
penned,&#8221; one well-known author has said of this
book, and we agree with him. Natalie is a
thoroughly lovable character, and one long to be
remembered. Published as are all the Amy Bell
Marlowe books, by Grosset &amp; Dunlap, New
York, and for sale by all booksellers. Ask your

<p>THE GIRLS OF HILLCREST FARM</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go to the old farm, and we&#8217;ll take
boarders! We can fix the old place up, and,
maybe, make money!&#8221;</p>
<p>The father of the two girls was broken down
in health and a physician had recommended that
he go to the country, where he could get plenty
of fresh air and sunshine. An aunt owned an
abandoned farm and she said the family could
live on this and use the place as they pleased.
It was great sport moving and getting settled,
and the boarders offered one surprise after another.
There was a mystery about the old farm,
and a mystery concerning one of the boarders,
and how the girls got to the bottom of affairs
is told in detail in the story, which is called, &#8220;The
Girls of Hillcrest Farm; Or, The Secret of the
Rocks.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was great fun to move to the farm, and once
the girls had the scare of their lives. And they
attended a great &#8220;vendue&#8221; too.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just had to write that story&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t help,
it,&#8221; said Miss Marlowe, when she handed in the
manuscript. &#8220;I knew just such a farm when I
was a little girl, and oh! what fun I had there!
And there was a mystery about that place, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>Published, like all the Marlowe books, by
Grosset &amp; Dunlap, New York, and for sale wherever
good books are sold.</p>

<p>A LITTLE MISS NOBODY</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s only a little nobody! Don&#8217;t have
anything to do with her!&#8221;</p>
<p>How often poor Nancy Nelson heard those
words, and how they cut her to the heart. And
the saying was true, she <i>was</i> a nobody. She had
no folks, and she did not know where she had
come from. All she did know was that she was
at a boarding school and that a lawyer paid her
tuition bills and gave her a mite of spending
money.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to find out who I am, and where
I came from,&#8221; said Nancy to herself, one day,
and what she did, and how it all ended, is absorbingly
related in &#8220;A Little Miss Nobody;
Or, With the Girls of Pinewood Hall.&#8221; Nancy
made a warm friend of a poor office boy who
worked for that lawyer, and this boy kept his
eyes and ears open and learned many things.</p>
<p>The book tells much about boarding school
life, of study and fun mixed, and of a great race
on skates. Nancy made some friends as well as
enemies, and on more than one occasion proved
that she was &#8220;true blue&#8221; in the best meaning
of that term.</p>

<p>THE GIRL FROM SUNSET RANCH</p>
</div>

<p>Helen was very thoughtful as she rode along
the trail from Sunset Ranch to the View. She
had lost her father but a month before, and
he had passed away with a stain on his name&mdash;a
stain of many years&#8217; standing, as the girl had just
found out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to New York and I am going to
clear his name!&#8221; she resolved, and just then she
saw a young man dashing along, close to the edge
of a cliff. Over he went, and Helen, with no
thought of the danger to herself, went to the
rescue.</p>
<p>Then the brave Western girl found herself set
down at the Grand Central Terminal in New
York City. She knew not which way to go or
what to do. Her relatives, who thought she was
poor and ignorant, had refused to even meet her.
She had to fight her way along from the start,
and how she did this, and won out, is well related
in &#8220;The Girl from Sunset Ranch; Or, Alone in
a Great City.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is one of the finest of Amy Bell Marlowe&#8217;s
books, with its true-to-life scenes of the plains
and mountains, and of the great metropolis.
Helen is a girl all readers will love from the
start.</p>

<p>WYN&#8217;S CAMPING DAYS</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Oh, girls, such news!&#8221; cried Wynifred Mallory
to her chums, one day. &#8220;We can go camping
on Lake Honotonka! Isn&#8217;t it grand!&#8221;</p>
<p>It certainly was, and the members of the Go-Ahead
Club were delighted. Soon they set off,
with their boy friends to keep them company in
another camp not far away. Those boys played
numerous tricks on the girls, and the girls retaliated,
you may be sure. And then Wyn did
a strange girl a favor, and learned how some
ancient statues of rare value had been lost in the
lake, and how the girl&#8217;s father was accused of
stealing them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must do all we can for that girl,&#8221; said
Wyn. But this was not so easy, for the girl
campers had many troubles of their own. They
had canoe races, and one of them fell overboard
and came close to drowning, and then came a big
storm, and a nearby tree was struck by lightning.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to love to go camping when a girl, and
I love to go yet,&#8221; said Miss Marlowe, in speaking
of this tale, which is called, &#8220;Wyn&#8217;s Camping
Days; Or, The Outing of the Go-Ahead Club.&#8221;
&#8220;I think all girls ought to know the pleasures of
summer life under canvas.&#8221;</p>
<p>A book that ought to be in the hands of all
girls. Issued by Grosset &amp; Dunlap, New York,
and for sale by booksellers everywhere.</p>
